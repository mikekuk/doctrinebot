ADP Land Operations is the British Army’s core doctrine. It provides the framework of understanding for our approach to combat and to operations. It is the foundation for all of our tactical doctrine. It recognises that the nature of warfare remains constant: it remains visceral and violent, characterised by friction, in which the simplest things become difficult; its outcomes are more often about the effects on peoples’ minds than they are about physical effects; and it is always about politics. This new edition is necessary because the character of conflict has evolved significantly due to the pervasiveness of information. 
The context is complex and dynamic. We live and fight in a goldfish bowl. There are few secrets any longer. We have access to multiple audiences and they have access to us. No longer is there a clear distinction between war and peace. We live in an era of constant competition
and confrontation in which our adversaries exploit the grey area short of combat operations 
to seek advantage. There is no boundary between what happens abroad and what happens
at home. Success is more likely to be achieved through non-military or non-lethal means, and invariably it is the triumph of the narrative that is decisive, not necessarily the facts on the ground. The battlefield is increasingly decentralized with a premium placed on the talent of low level leadership and its understanding of the strategic context. And the expectations of military restraint, as well as the complexity of the legal context, constrain commanders as never before. 
The two central ideas in British Doctrine remain constant. The requirement for Mission Command and the Manoeuvrist Approach has not changed, however the latter is focused on the enemy – and in this complex and dynamic environment manoeuvre has to take account of a much broader audience than simply the ‘enemy’. A new idea is therefore required - this is called Integrated Action. It is a unifying doctrine that requires commanders first to identify their outcome; second to study all of the audiences that are relevant to the attainment of the outcome; third to analyse the effects that need to be imparted on the relevant audience; before determining the best mix of capabilities, from soft through to hard power, required to impart effect onto those audiences to achieve the outcome. 
Put simply, doctrine is not just what is taught, it also captures a set of beliefs – the beliefs that underpin how we practise our profession. ADP Land Operations should be read by all, applied at the appropriate level, and used intelligently as the framework of understanding to inform our Army’s development in this increasingly complex and dynamic context.

Part 1 provides the context from which flow the fundamentals of land doctrine. While the nature of conflict endures, the character evolves. Certain themes are likely to shape the character of contemporary conflict into the early 2020s. These include the continued proliferation and speed of information, and the instability of a
world characterised by constant competition between an array of actors, many of whom seek to undermine the international rules-based order. As well as through traditional tactics and strategies in the physical domain, we and our opponents increasingly use and contest the virtual domain, through digital media and cyber. The information age allows adversaries – unconstrained by Western policy, ethical and legal codes – to exploit our vulnerabilities in novel ways. It also means that for UK land forces, and our allies and partners, tactical success is increasingly difficult to achieve
in purely physical terms. Most importantly, it is not possible to translate tactical success into desirable political outcomes without gaining favourable consensus among multiple audiences. 
Chapter 1 describes the nature and character of conflict and their implications for land forces. Chapter 2 summarises the national context and higher level conceptual frameworks, common across NATO, which aid understanding of the land force contribution to operations. Chapter 3 explains how the concept of fighting Power is applied by UK land forces. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The nature and character of conflict are different. The fundamental nature of conflict does not change; it is adversarial, human and political.
Yet each conflict has a different character.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The timeless aspects of land conflict are the
nature of conflict, the land environment, and the
inherent attributes of armies. The character of
conflict changes continuously, as a consequence
of a number of factors, including the politics and
technology of the age, and each conflict’s unique
causes, participants, technology and geography.
When the UK is a participant, our particular political, economic, geographic
and historical position becomes a factor in the character of the conflict that we experience. Because each conflict is unique, a single description of the character of contemporary conflict is not possible. But it is important to understand the factors that influence character, and the general implications of those factors.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The concept of the nature and character of conflict informs our approach
to doctrine, force design, education and training. Deductions from the
nature of conflict inform enduring principles and ideas, while those from the character of conflict allow us to prepare appropriately for the requirements of contemporary operations. It is essential to draw on both in the right balance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
This chapter first describes the enduring nature of conflict, the land environment and armies. It then examines how the character of contemporary conflict is affected by three particular aspects: the way people communicate; the proliferation and power of weapons; and evolving strategies and tactics. It concludes with the implications of the nature and character of conflict for land forces, and, in Annex 1A, the Principles of War.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Whether the belligerents are states or other entities, all armed conflict is essentially adversarial, human (involving friction, uncertainty, violence and stress) and political.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Conflict is a reciprocal contest of will, in which multiple adversaries and actors act and react to each other, often unpredictably, in a struggle to succeed. Adversaries seek constantly to mitigate their own weaknesses, avoid opponents’ strengths, and focus instead on aligning their strengths against weaknesses.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As human dynamics lie at the heart of all conflict, it follows that the nature of conflict will continue to be influenced by and represent the entire spectrum of human behaviour, emotion and capability. As a human activity, it cannot be reduced to scientific templates and principles, but relies on initiative, enterprise and intelligence. Conflict will always
be a violent contest between humans, marked by friction, uncertainty, chaos, violence, danger and stress, affecting the participants’ will to fight and function. As social animals who respond to leadership and friendship, we tend to organise ourselves to fight in hierarchical groups. Our physiology limits what we can do physically; we cannot go
for long without food, sleep and shelter, for example. Our psychology means that our decisions and behaviour are informed by our perceptions of what is happening. These subjective perceptions contribute to the enduring unpredictability of conflict on land.
a. friction frustrates action; makes the simple difficult; and the difficult seemingly impossible. friction may be mental, perhaps caused by indecision, or physical, for example caused by the effects of violence. While friction can be imposed upon opponents with great effect, it can also be imposed on us by an adversary or the environment, or be self-induced, for example by a poor plan, process or organisational structure.
b. No matter how much information there is in conflict, a ‘fog of war’ that can lead to uncertainty and chaos will always descend. Chaos might be deliberately used by enemies, and presents opportunities for the bold to seize.
c. The threat or use of violence is the means by which one side in armed conflict ultimately seeks to impose their will upon the other. Violence can result in bloodshed, destruction and human suffering. Applying appropriate violence at the right time and place can be decisive.
d. Combat can be horrific, and violence, danger, stress, fear, exhaustion, isolation and privation, or their prospect, adversely affect the will of all those involved. Success in battle is as often decided by the psychological ability of each side to withstand these shocks as it is by physical results.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The use or threat of violence to achieve political objectives has endured through
the ages. Clausewitz’s observation that “war is not merely an act of policy but a true political instrument, a continuation of political intercourse, carried on with other means”
remains relevant today. Confrontation and conflict involve persistent political competition and disagreement, which from time to time are manifested in armed violence; all conflicts are blends of ‘battlefield’ and ‘non-battlefield’ engagements. Conflict is a means to an end, not an end in itself. The initiation, continuance and termination of conflict are all political decisions, and so the employment of the military instrument
of power ought to be in pursuit of political objectives. The pervasive nature of politics in conflict shapes the manner in which operations are conducted by land forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The land environment has human, information and physical aspects. Most people live in towns, cities and villages, and increasingly in coastal regions. There are very few areas in which no people live; even then, most apparently unpopulated space is a resource that supports the population in some way. People exist in linguistic, cultural, social, and political groups with specific identities, usually associated with particular territories. These territories typically take the form of states, or regions within or between them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The significance of territory is, therefore, associated with group identity and access to resources; it is often rooted in deep cultural and historical factors as well as in governments’ obligations to provide security for their people. Competition for territory and resources, and issues such as injustice and lack of representation are often at the root of conflict.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Because of its significance, the physical capture and occupation of territory, or the credible threat to do so, has often been regarded as decisive. But, the ultimate decision is political rather than physical; people have to decide whether or not to accept the facts on the ground. Land forces, by dint of their presence among and proximity to the people, provide an important and usually necessary contribution to achieving these political outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The land environment is also shaped by the way that information is exchanged between individuals, tribes, ethnic and interest groups, and countries. This communication can be verbal, directly between people, through radio, television, and online. Human interaction is expanding and accelerating as information flows
in the virtual domain increase. In the new information landscape, any digitally connected person has the ability to shape public understanding of and consensus for (or against) a conflict, or be influenced by other actors who exploit these means.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Terrain in the land environment is varied and complex, with open grassland, cultivated land, forests, mountains, deserts, jungles, rivers, swamps, urban and littoral areas. each creates constraints and freedoms, placing different demands on the people and equipment that operate within them. Terrain can block or enable communication, provide cover from detection or attack, and obstruct or enable movement. Movement on land is impeded by obstacles that land forces must overcome. Land forces have to be highly adaptable and resilient to operate in these different conditions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The land itself can also be altered by human activity. Obstacles can be cleared and roads built to enable access. Globally, the phenomenon of urbanisation is creating physically, culturally and institutionally complex cities that are challenging for military forces operating in them. In the littoral, the complexities of the urban environment for land forces are amplified. Other strategic trends, including competition for resources, economic inequality and climate change continue to dictate where and how people live.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Climate accentuates the demands of terrain. It also affects visibility, movement and communication. Climate can bring danger and threaten our very survival, but it also brings opportunities that sustain life and provide protection. Night operations can provide cover and the element of surprise, but strain the ability to retain effective command and control.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The capability of armed forces is often described using the concept of fighting Power. fighting Power consists of three components: conceptual (the ideas behind how to operate and fight); moral (the ability to get people to operate and fight); and physical (the means to operate and fight). Land, maritime and air forces all have fighting Power, but they have different, yet complementary attributes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The nature of conflict and the land environment are timelessly relevant to all land forces. They inform the concept of land power, and the attributes of land forces that inform doctrine and force design. Building on these attributes, a land force needs certain qualities if it is to be able to exercise land power effectively.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military power is mainly divided into complementary maritime, land, air and space power, alongside cyber and information capabilities. Land power is the ability to exert control within the land environment and to influence the behaviour of actors and the course of events. Air and maritime power can be applied to the land, but cannot fully control the land; this can only be done from within the land environment by land forces (often with the essential support of maritime, air and space power).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
All land forces, regular or irregular, have four inherent attributes. each attribute has advantages that can be used, but also disadvantages that have to be avoided or mitigated.
a. The primary attribute of any land force is its people. Land conflict is a human activity, between individuals and groups of individuals. each of these participants has their own perceptions and interpretations of the environment. Land forces, therefore,
are complex organisations, requiring moral as well as structural cohesion and deep hierarchies of command. They can be difficult to direct, so decentralised command systems tend to work best. Large numbers of people can also be expensive and lead to competition with other sectors of society requiring skilled personnel. Land forces are particularly reliant on high quality leadership, education and training at all levels.
b. Land forces’ presence on the ground means that they operate in close proximity to people and terrain. Soldiers are able to gain access to people and communicate directly with them. This gives them the potential to develop detailed understanding of the human, information and physical aspects of the environment. They can get close enough to distinguish between different people and groups, adjusting their approach accordingly. They present a particular kind of threat to adversaries, and are uniquely able to reassure and secure neutral and friendly people. Land forces can manoeuvre over ground, or via air or water, to take physical possession of terrain, or they can physically defend or secure it. The presence of land forces, therefore, is often essential for success which may only be achievable by fighting. The same presence, however, can also disturb local relationships, cause people to feel threatened, and become a focus for resistance to which land forces are uniquely vulnerable. Sometimes this threat is mitigated by small or discreet deployments that contribute out of proportion to their size. To operate effectively, land forces must be able to understand and cooperate with local actors.
c. The attribute of persistence, the capacity of land forces to extend their presence in an area for long periods of time, gives land forces the potential to deepen their understanding of the local context, and develop engagement, control and influence. Presence and persistence can be highly significant, if matched by political commitment. Persistent engagement requires sustainment and protection commensurate with the threats, the distance of the task from the home base and its duration.
d. Land forces have inherent versatility because they consist largely of organised groups that can relatively easily conduct a very wide range of military and non-military tasks. So even when optimised for warfighting, land forces can be adapted to support, for example, stability and non-conflict activities such as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although all land forces display these attributes, it does not follow that they are all effective on operations. To be effective, land (as well as maritime and air) forces require certain other qualities including: balance between their human and physical aspects; the ability to start operations at the appropriate time and place and to continue for as long as the operation demands; and the right level of force. The key quality which alters these properties so they are relevant in new and changing situations is adaptability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although land forces are inherently versatile, they must be adaptable to deal with new and changing situations. future conflict cannot be predicted accurately, so land forces must prepare for the most complex and demanding operations but be able to adapt rapidly to specific operational requirements. Having adjusted to deal with the new situation, the force must adapt during conflict. Adversaries and enemies seek to deceive and surprise us, and themselves adapt: if we are to succeed we must adapt more quickly than they do. Adaptability is explained further in Chapter 3.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
No two conflicts are the same and none retains a fixed character. each is the product of its era and of the particular conditions which apply at the time. The ever- changing character of conflict is influenced by global political, economic, social, and technological factors. Significant developments can cause marked changes to the general character of conflict. examples include the growth of democracy and the invention of mass manufacturing. But the most significant impact has often been from changes in technology, such as gunpowder, the internal combustion engine, wireless communications, powered flight, nuclear weapons, computers and the Internet.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In addition, the goals of belligerents, their relative strengths and popular support, as well as their tactics and strategies, will always differ and so give each conflict its own unique character. Further, the character of any given conflict does not remain constant; as a contest of wills, conflicts change over their duration. Adversaries constantly adapt their tactics and strategies to gain advantage, whilst technologies evolve and new threats emerge.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
It is not possible to predict the exact character of contemporary conflict, because it is constantly changing and each conflict is unique and evolves in its own way. Nevertheless, certain trends and developments are apparent, of which global connectivity and the accelerating flow of information are currently the most important. Although each conflict must be examined in its own right, three inter-related aspects of contemporary conflict are clear: the way in which people communicate; the proliferation and ever-increasing power of physical weapons; and evolving strategies and tactics.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Rapid and broad communication of messages and ideas flow across physical boundaries through the virtual domain, energising the causes for which people fight. Adversaries can develop and exploit recruitment, manipulation, mobilisation and targeting opportunities, while promoting their own narratives of events, in competition with our own. Our adversaries can share information and adapt more quickly than in the past.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Because of the proliferation of information, military activity is often immediately visible to a local and global audience. The local audience includes enemies, adversaries and a range of actors, from allies and partners to the local population. The global audience is unbounded. each of these groups interprets our activity through their own lens, and each is influenced by others. Many actors are adept at presenting military activity to the audience, magnifying, mitigating or altering it to influence observers’ understanding of what actually happened. This is critically important to us, our allies and adversaries, because the audience judges whether military action achieves its political objectives. The impact of physical military activity can have more immediate, wide-ranging consequences than in the past, for example more quickly deterring, demoralising or stiffening the resolve of other actors.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As we and other actors become more and more reliant on sophisticated information services, so the threat of cyber attack increases. This novel threat has the potential to disrupt our information services and any systems that rely on electronic control systems.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As our military operations become more visible, and come under greater domestic and international scrutiny and criticism, there is a higher expectation of military restraint compared with the past. This often leads to legal and policy constraints on our use of force additional to the requirements of international law. Many of our actual and potential adversaries do not recognise international law, and do not have the same constraints. They are able to exploit this situation to their advantage by, for example, concealing themselves in the population, using tactics and weapons not available to us, or causing us to be restricted by our own (legitimate) rules.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The power of physical weapons continues to increase, and these weapons are often available to irregular forces. Chemical weapons are used and biological, nuclear and radiological weapons remain a threat. fires and explosives continue to dominate and shape the tactical battlespace, whether, for example, delivered by long range rocket systems or in the form of improvised explosive devices. These are what destroy things and kill and injure people; therefore they have the greatest resonance in the eyes of the participants and observers of conflict.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Air power remains a critical factor in the successful application of land power, and space capability is increasingly important. Aircraft are a very powerful and effective means of delivering fires, and they are a key contributor to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), and sustainment. Those states able to use space have particular strengths in ISR and communications.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The proliferation of commercially available technology means that secure communications, cyber capabilities, and surveillance systems including unmanned air systems are easily acquired or improvised, even by irregular forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The recent period has seen the emergence of the concept of ‘hybrid warfare’. This describes strategies that are not new, but which are increasingly employed by state and non-state actors. Potential adversaries are demonstrating the will and capability to undermine Western operational capability, resolve and legitimacy by blending conventional and unconventional forms of conflict, using both attributable and non-attributable methods. These include posturing, provocation and persuasion in the physical and virtual domains; subversion; and economic and cyber warfare, with or without the employment of conventional military forces. This ‘hybrid’ threat to the international rules-based order can be applied in a way that remains below formal Western military response thresholds. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Certain implications for UK land forces and doctrine can be derived from the land environment, the nature and character of conflict and the attributes inherent in land forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are four functions of Land Power – to fight, engage, secure and support. They draw on the attributes of Land forces and can be exercised independently or in combinations.
a. The fundamental capability of land forces is to fight in the most demanding circumstances. This capability underpins the other three functions; gives credibility to deterrence, coercion and containment and other strategies; and is essential for interventions and territorial defence.
b. Land forces can engage with a range of actors and audiences, directly and indirectly, contributing to understanding, influence and conflict prevention.
c. Land forces are particularly able to secure and protect people and places persistently in the land environment. This includes providing security in support of inter-agency stabilisation and reconstruction.
d. Land forces can support and assist state and non-state institutions. They can provide mass and presence as well as specialist capabilities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In a single conflict environment, land forces may simultaneously perform all four functions (fight, engage, secure, support), integrating different types of operation. for example, while one element of the force is conducting high intensity combat operations, others may be engaged in humanitarian relief, counter-insurgency or capacity building. each type of operation may also contain the full range of tactical activities – offensive, defensive, enabling and stability. The relationship between types of operations, activities and conflict can be visualised as a mosaic of conflict, formed of small pieces, all of which are required to see the full picture. each piece of the mosaic represents a tactical activity or group of activities. 
<|endoftext|>


<|startoftext|>
Land conflict today requires a force and soldiers with high contemporary skills. Conflict involves new technologies, emerging threats, many potential operating environments, and adversaries and enemies who seek to deceive and surprise us. Within the land force, a broad range of skills are required, from highly sophisticated technical and cyber knowledge to proficiency in languages and psychology, to individual physical robustness.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces require highly effective leadership. Morale, will, adaptation and the ability to cooperate with others are all essential requirements of land forces, and are given strength by leadership throughout the hierarchy and in all elements of the force. Commanders must inspire confidence and be decisive and resilient in the face of adversity, judicious and flexible.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As the audience’s judgement is an increasingly significant factor in contemporary conflict, operations must be designed and conducted accordingly. No conflict has a purely military solution, and overall success requires favourable consensus among a diverse audience. How we say, how we behave and what we do, influence how we are seen must be consistent and appropriate. At the margin, a neutral or nearly neutral outcome of military action can be turned into a success or a failure by how it is perceived.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Because military force is used to achieve political outcomes, it should be consciously aimed at altering people’s behaviour. The application and threat of force, and the gaining and retention of physical objectives should be used to affect people’s decision making in ways consistent with our goals. for this reason, in combat physical destruction and damage is used to achieve two things: an immediate local reduction in enemy capability; and more importantly, wider damage to the enemy’s will and cohesion. The most efficient and often most effective way to achieve this is by creating and attacking weaknesses to demoralise and disintegrate the enemy, rather than attacking strength head-on to destroy as much equipment, manpower and materiel as possible.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As well as fighting and providing security, land forces are in a position to communicate directly with individuals and groups involved in a conflict. To change or maintain the behaviour of these actors, land forces should integrate the use of force with communications in a mutually reinforcing way. In turn, to achieve political outcomes, they must integrate their activity with that of the diplomatic and economic instruments of power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The particular nature of friction in land conflict, coupled with the necessary organisation of land forces, has implications for the way in which command is best conducted. There are a number of methods, but decentralised command is highly effective in hierarchical land forces operating in a context of friction, uncertainty and chaos. It empowers leaders down to the lowest level, enabling subordinate commanders to rapidly identify and exploit opportunities to achieve their commander’s intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
If operations are to be effective, land forces must develop a good understanding of the important aspects of the operating environment. This requires them to comprehend the relevant human, information and physical aspects of a given situation. It is particularly important to understand how to influence and assess behaviour, and how the audience is likely to perceive our actions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces must develop interoperability at a number of levels. Within the force, different specialist branches must cooperate in the field. The land force must also cooperate with maritime and air forces, as well as with allies and other agencies.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
It is essential that forces are held at the appropriate readiness so that they can be prepared appropriately and applied at the right time and place.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The relative ease with which our activities can be observed, commented on
and interpreted by multiple audiences makes previous operational and non- operational distinctions less valid. even relatively minor armed conflicts have potentially global consequences, for example through diaspora of people with common identities or transnational economic dependencies. Actions and challenges at home can have repercussions for deployed forces. Threats overseas can rapidly migrate to the home base, requiring increased focus by land forces on homeland resilience and security tasks in support of the civil authority. Moreover, how our armed forces are perceived when they conduct ‘non-operational’ activity, for example, training or recruiting, is increasingly likely to influence the operational audience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Since the effects of even distant conflicts have consequences domestically and for the international rules-based order, there is a strategic imperative for land forces to contribute to improved security in relevant parts of the world. Military power, complementary to other instruments of state power, can contribute through early and persistent engagement overseas, capacity building of local security forces, and by deterrence. In doing so, land forces can develop the understanding, relationships and outlook necessary should conflict occur.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Above all, as each of these implications imply, the general character of conflict is changing rapidly, and the conflicts in which we might be involved are many and varied, it follows that to be effective, our land forces must be highly adaptable.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Throughout history, many military thinkers have proposed enduring Principles of War, based on their assessment of the nature of warfare. These were intended as guidelines to warfighting. Some thinkers thought that these could be followed as if they were scientific rules, but the longstanding view now is that effective land operations, deeply human as they are, are as much of an art as a science. It follows that there are no rules that guarantee military success, only guidelines. Despite the changes in the character of conflict, the UK’s Principles
of War remain highly relevant. They are listed and explained at Annex 1A.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Principles of War.
• the Principles of War provide comprehensive considerations at all levels for planning and executing campaigns and operations. They are not absolute or prescriptive, but provide a foundation for adversary-focused military activity and doctrine. With the exception of the master principle, which is placed first, the relative importance of each may vary according to context, and their application according to judgement, common sense and intelligent interpretation. While the UK’s Principles of War are consistent with the Principles of Operations applied by NATO, there are some differences. Allied Joint Publication 01 Allied Joint Doctrine lists the principles of Allied joint and multinational operations.
• selection and maintenance of the aim. Selection and maintenance of the aim is the master Principle of War. When conducting military operations, at every level, it is essential to select and define the aim clearly. The aim provides a focus for coordinated effort and a reference point against which to assess progress. A hierarchy of aims at different levels is required. There should be a strategic aim supported by a number of operational aims, themselves supported by an array of tactical aims which are steps on the path towards that strategic aim. following this principle prevents unnecessary activity and conserves resources. The overall aim must pervade subordinate operations so that they contribute to achieving the desired outcome. In practice, uncertainty, political reality and insufficient initial understanding of a situation frequently conspire against setting an unambiguous aim from the outset. Nevertheless, military commanders have an obligation to their subordinates, partners, allies and political leaders to define a mission appropriate to their level of command, based on their detailed understanding of the operational requirement and context. This same understanding will also avoid blinkered rigidity. It also enables, through Mission Command, identification of when a fresh aim is required as well as, exploitation of success and adaptation to the ever evolving environment. The maintenance of the aim ensures that the whole force remains focused on the outcome and every subordinate on their commander’s intent.
• Maintenance of morale. Morale is a positive state of mind – a will to win – which depends on strong leadership. It consists of fighting spirit, moral cohesion, discipline, comradeship, pride in self and unit, confidence in equipment and sustainment, and a firm spiritual foundation. High morale enables a land force to fight offensively and overcome the privations of conflict, not only for a single battle or engagement, but for a campaign. It can inspire an army from the highest to the lowest ranks. Success in land operations depends as much on moral factors as physical ones.
• Offensive action. It is through offensive action that a commander seeks to gain advantage, sustain momentum and seize and retain the initiative. As it is an active rather than passive approach, it is the primary means open to a commander to influence the outcome of a campaign or a battle. Defensive operations that do not include offensive action are often unsuccessful and rarely tactically decisive. effective offensive action relies on high morale and is often a way of gaining ascendancy over the enemy and the confidence of allies and partners.
• security. An appropriate degree of physical security and information denial is essential to all military operations. Security enables (and is in turn enhanced by) surprise and deception, and is essential in preserving the capability of the force; ultimately it helps to provide freedom of action. It involves the judicious management of risk, because in conflict it is not possible to protect everything all of the time.
• surprise. Surprise is a potent psychological weapon, causing shock through unexpected action in time, space and method. enabled by security, surprise involves using secrecy, concealment, deception, originality, audacity or tempo to confuse, paralyse or disrupt effective decision-making, and undermine an adversary’s cohesion and morale. Surprising an adversary is a significant way of seizing the initiative and must be central to the design of all combat operations. Surprise is by nature transient, as shock and confusion recede over time, so its effects should be exploited rapidly and aggressively. Commanders should anticipate the effects of being surprised themselves and make appropriate plans to safeguard their freedom of action.
• Concentration of force. Concentration of force requires the decisive, synchronised application of effort and resource at the critical point in time and space to achieve the commander’s intent. The nature of the force concentrated will depend on the mission and will include elements of manoeuvre, fires, information activities and capacity building. The main effort describes the activity where a commander assigns the greatest concentration of force. Commanders must accept that concentration of force on the main effort can, however, create vulnerabilities and will entail economy of effort elsewhere.
• economy of effort. The consequence of concentration of force is economy of effort. It is impossible to be strong everywhere, so if decisive strength is to be concentrated at the critical time and place there must be no wasteful expenditure of effort where it cannot significantly affect the issue.
• Flexibility. flexibility is the ability to change rapidly, appropriately and effectively to new circumstances. It comprises the versatility, responsiveness, resilience and adaptability of the whole force. Versatility is the physical and structural ability to perform many functions. Responsiveness is a measure of speed of action, reaction and of how quickly the initiative can be seized or regained. Resilience is the degree to which people and their equipment remain effective under arduous conditions or in the face of hostile action. Adaptability embraces the need to learn quickly, to adjust to changes in a dynamic situation, and to amend plans that, in the light of experience, seem unlikely to lead to a suitable outcome.
• Cooperation. Military operations are joint enterprises. Their success requires cooperation between all participants. These include individuals and groups of actors who may be military or civilian, governmental or non-governmental, national, allied or from host nations. Within the land force, the cooperation of all arms in combined arms forces is critical. Cooperation is best engendered through shared training, which develops interoperability, team spirit and cohesion. It relies upon: mutual trust and goodwill; unity of purpose, if not command; and common understanding of responsibilities, capabilities and limitations.
• sustainability. Sustainability is the ability of a force to maintain the necessary level of combat power for the duration required to achieve its objectives without culmination. fighting Power, freedom of action and operational success rest on the sustainability of the force through every stage of a campaign, from force preparation through to redeployment and recuperation. A rigorous assessment of logistic realities is essential to operational planning; indeed, it is often the deciding factor in assessing the feasibility of an operational choice.

Chapter 2 expands on the UK national context, introduces the important concepts of campaign authority, legitimacy and legality, and describes the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) framework of operations and relationships within which operations are conducted. It concludes with a summary of the contribution of UK land forces to strategy and joint operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK is a liberal democracy, an island nation in europe, and a member of many international political, economic and security-orientated organisations. Notably, from a security perspective, the UK is a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council and a member of NATO. Relatively small in size and population, the UK has global economic, social and political responsibilities, including for UK dependencies and citizens. Security threats include: terrorism, cyber attack, international military conflict and the re-emergence of state based threats, overseas instability, environmental, health and natural hazards.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In tackling these challenges, the UK government employs three instruments of power: diplomatic, economic and military, all underpinned by information. The military instrument can be costly and is relatively small; its resilience depends on its ability to regenerate; and it is increasingly reliant on global partners rather than on a national, strategic industrial base.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
These geopolitical factors, as well as deductions from the nature and character of conflict, inform the ways in which UK land forces approach and conduct operations.
a. UK land operations at any scale are almost always multinational, reflecting relationships with allies and partners, and mitigating the relatively small size of our land forces. Although capable of acting independently, alliances and partnerships are fundamental to our approach to defence and security. Collective security is promoted primarily, but not exclusively, through NATO and enduring bilateral relationships with, for example, the United States and france. UK land doctrine, therefore, must be coherent with NATO’s, with exceptions made clear.
b. The UK, like any country, cannot afford to lose the force. A warfighting division constitutes the centre of gravity of the UK’s land forces. We must seek to apply strength against vulnerabilities, always protecting the will and cohesion of the force.
c. UK land forces must be ready to deal with a wide variety of threats and conflict situations. They must be able to adapt rapidly to new challenges, while supporting Government strategy to prevent conflict and instability. They must be maintained at the right level of competence and readiness. Major operations will be overseas and almost always multinational. UK land forces must be effective operating within formations larger than they possess, requiring understanding of and influence within higher level allied formations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
UK Armed forces are subject to political direction, democratic oversight, and national and international law. for military actions to be effective in this context, they must be legitimate and lawful, and be perceived as such.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Campaign authority is the authority established by international forces, agencies and organisations within a given situation. It comprises four interdependent factors: the perceived legitimacy of the mandate; the manner in which those exercising the mandate conduct themselves, individually and collectively; the extent to which factions, local populations and others consent to, comply with, or resist the authority of those executing the mandate; and the extent to which the audience’s expectations are met by those executing the mandate. Campaign authority is not simply granted to the mission, but has to be earned and maintained. Without campaign authority, it is difficult, if not impossible, to convert military success into desired political outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Legitimacy encompasses the legal, moral, political, diplomatic and ethical propriety of the conduct of military forces. As the justification for using force, and the manner in which it is applied, legitimacy has collective and individual aspects, both of which directly affect the utility of force. Legitimacy is based upon inter-related subjective factors, such as the perceptions and beliefs of audiences, and objective legal matters. for example, operations are increasingly subject to judicial oversight, reflecting political responses to domestic expectations, themselves informed by regulated and unregulated media reporting of military activities. When preparing for and conducting operations, land forces must understand how their actions may be perceived by a global as well as a domestic and local audience, ensuring that they act lawfully and ethically at all times.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The most fundamental and enduring requirement for campaign authority and legitimacy is that our actions are lawful. The increasing incorporation of evolving Western civilian norms into our legal system, resulting in increased judicial scrutiny of military conduct, makes the legal dimension of operations both complex and potentially constraining. The legal aspects described below are only an introduction to this important subject, which requires focused study and training prior to and during operations.
a. Law and policy are different. Sometimes, constraints are imposed on commanders as matters of policy, rather than law. examples of these are rules of engagement (ROe), and directives for targeting and the handling of captured personnel, which may restrict military activity even though the law may be more permissive.
b. UK forces, whether overseas or in the UK, operate within a legal framework. All service personnel, wherever they serve, are subject to Service law as provided by the Armed forces Act 2006. However, in the UK, civilian authorities may exercise primacy. Soldiers are held legally accountable through the Service Justice System for offences covered by the Armed forces Act 2006, irrespective of where the offence is committed. When deployed, various international laws may also apply, including host nation law and international human rights law. To these may be added rights and obligations placed on the UK under a United Nations Security Resolution or bilateral/multilateral agreements such as status of forces agreements, technical arrangements and memoranda of understanding. On multinational operations, other nations’ forces may not all be subject to the same legal framework – their applicable domestic laws, for example, are likely to be different. The legal framework will vary between operations and at different times and places within a campaign as it progresses.
c. Law governs the use of force in a number of ways. It regulates when states can resort to using force, for example by sending their troops onto the sovereign territory of another state. It also establishes how force can be lawfully used once those troops have been deployed, whether in an armed conflict, on a peacekeeping mission or other operation. It is important to distinguish between laws that regulate how a state may act, and those that govern the conduct of individuals and units. Commanders at all levels are responsible for ensuring that forces under their command operate within the law. At the same time, each individual remains ultimately responsible in law for their actions.
d. Military operations must comply with the underpinning principles of the law of armed conflict – military necessity, humanity, distinction and proportionality – so that they are consistent with the wider ethical considerations from which the law is derived. As well as governing the use of force, the law of armed conflict also, for example, provides protections and rights for captured persons and prohibits acts of deception that amount to perfidy. The basic principles of the law of armed conflict are described in JSP 383 and summarised below:
(1) Military necessity requires that only the necessary amount of armed force
is applied. This force is controlled, lawful and directed towards achieving the complete or partial submission of an enemy at the earliest possible moment, and with the minimum expenditure of life and resources.
(2) The principle of humanity forbids the infliction of suffering, injury, or destruction not actually necessary for the accomplishment of legitimate military purposes. Also prohibited is the use of weapons, means and methods of warfare of a nature that cause superfluous injury and unnecessary suffering.
(3) The principle of distinction demands that land forces distinguish between enemy forces and non-combatants. Non-combatants include civilians and certain individuals within an enemy force, most notably, for example, medical and religious personnel. Any intentional direct attack against the civilian population or civilian objects is prohibited and may amount to a war crime.
(4) Armed forces only use force in proportionality to the military end sought. What is proportionate can only be judged in the particular prevailing circumstances at the time. This judgement requires careful deliberation and will be informed at all stages by considerations of the above three principles by individuals throughout the chain of command.
e. rules of engagement (ROe) are commanders’ directives – in other words policy and operational guidance – sitting within the legal framework rather than law themselves. They are expressed as permissions and prohibitions which govern where armed forces can go, what they can do and, to an extent, how and when certain actions can be carried out. They are designed to ensure that action taken by UK forces is lawful and consistent with government policy. They are also used to enhance operational security, avoid fratricide and to avoid counter-productive effects which could destabilise a campaign. ROe do not by themselves guarantee the lawfulness of action; it remains the individual’s responsibility in law to ensure that any use of force is lawful. ROe do not restrict the inherent and inalienable right of an individual to act in self-defence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces, as a component of the military instrument of power, conduct operations within a framework that describe the levels and types of operations. This allows them to harmonise their contribution to alliance, coalition, national and defence objectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The framework of the strategic, operational and tactical levels of warfare are used to command, categorise and define military activity. The structure and discipline of these levels help to maintain a clear integrity of purpose between the state, its armed forces and their missions. The levels delineate delegated responsibilities for the use of armed force, but these distinctions are not required to control economic and diplomatic power. The levels of warfare are not tied to specific military levels of command. Depending on the situation, corps, division, brigade, battlegroup or unit commanders may all operate at either the operational or tactical level. It should be noted that the levels, if they are recognised at all, may be interpreted or applied differently, depending on the situation, by multinational partners and other government departments.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The strategic level is the level at which a nation or group of nations determines national or multinational security objectives, and deploys national, including military, resources to achieve them. Land forces require an understanding, at all levels, of the evolving strategic context of their actions. In a globalised, networked battlespace, there are few situations where tactical activity cannot have strategic consequences. Encompassing all aspects of national, defence and military strategy, in the planning and execution of operations, three aspects of strategy are particularly relevant to military forces.
a. A successful national strategy sets out a path, using the diplomatic, economic and military instruments of power, to achieve government policy goals. Strategy usually involves collaboration with other nations’ governments and armed forces and other international organisations. In a multinational context, constituent states have their own national strategies, which should be coherent with the remainder of the alliance or coalition. National strategy consists of and should describe interdependent ‘ends’ (objectives of the strategy), ‘ways’ (methods) and ‘means’ (resources).
b. The military contribution to strategy is the application of military resources to achieve national strategic objectives. During planning for operations, military planners determine military objectives, identify freedoms and constraints, set out options for the desired end-state and describe the military approach and resources required. This enables coherent military advice to be given to UK Government decision-makers by the Chief of the Defence Staff and the Chiefs of Staff. A decision is then made and the campaign is conducted.
c. A successful campaign requires a strategic narrative, described in joint doctrine as communication that portrays a story designed to resonate in the mind of the audience that helps explain the campaign strategy and operational plan. This message must resonate to those deployed, and the domestic and broader international audience, including in the conflict region. It will be contested; adversaries will create their own narratives in support of their goals, or perhaps multiple narratives to confuse the audience so that our narrative fails to gain traction. A compelling strategic narrative, reinforced at operational and tactical levels and coherent with actions taken, has the potential to be decisive in developing favourable public consensus and maintaining campaign authority.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The operational level is the level at which campaigns and major operations are planned, conducted and sustained to accomplish strategic objectives within theatres or areas of operations. The operational level provides the gearing between the strategic and tactical levels. Joint campaigns and operations are constructed and directed at the operational level to fulfil national, alliance or coalition strategy. An operational commander designs, plans, sequences and sustains a campaign according to the authorised campaign plan. Joint doctrine concentrates on the operational level, unifying tactical and environmental operations into a coherent campaign through joint action. Joint action is defined as the deliberate use and orchestration of military capabilities and activities to affect actors’ will, understanding and capability, and the cohesion between them to achieve influence. It is implemented through the orchestration of information activities, fires, manoeuvre and outreach.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The tactical level is the level at which activities, battles and engagements are planned and executed to accomplish military objectives assigned to tactical formations and units. It is at the tactical level that troops are deployed directly in tactical activities, using the tactical functions. Couched in the context of the strategic and operational levels, the focus of this Army Doctrine Publication is on how tactical land operations are conducted.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
British Army doctrine follows the NATO codification of operations themes, types of operation and tactical activities. This enhances interoperability
with allies and aids understanding of the mosaic of conflict. Those relevant to land operations are shown in figure 1.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operations may be assigned or described in terms of particular contextual themes. These operations themes allow the general conditions of the operating environment to be understood, informing the intellectual approach, resources available (including force levels, rules of engagement and force protection measures), likely activities required and levels of political appetite and risk. There are four themes, aligned to the functions of land power: warfighting, security, peace support and defence engagement. These themes provide a framework for understanding in general terms the context and dynamics of a conflict. A theme may be set at the strategic level and form part of the narrative for operations, but this will not necessarily happen. As a conflict evolves, the thematic designation may change. It is important for the operational and strategic levels of command, informed by tactical commanders, to anticipate the need for any change. Within a single operations theme more than one type of operation will often occur simultaneously. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within the operations themes, certain types of operation exist. They are not mutually exclusive and are often concurrent with other types of operation within the mosaic of conflict. As doctrinal definitions, they are neither designed nor do they necessarily correspond to UK Defence planning tools or assumptions. Rather, they aid analysis and articulation  of complex missions and provide the essential gearing required to sequence a series of tactical activities to achieve operational objectives. This doctrine groups types of operations into combat, stability and military aid to the civil authority (MACA) operations. Stability operations (which NATO describes as crisis response operations) and MACA are UK terms. This doctrine also includes an additional, discrete type of operation described as capacity building. Types of operation and operations themes are covered in more detail in Annex 8C. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within all types of operation, land forces conduct all or some of a range of tactical activities, often concurrently. The balance between the different activities varies from one operation to another over time, as illustrated in figure 1
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Tactical activities are either offensive, defensive, stability or enabling. In the mosaic of conflict a force may be required to conduct all activities simultaneously. Also, these activities are not mutually exclusive. A single force element may link them by a simple transition from one activity to another without breaking contact with an enemy; for instance from a defensive activity to an offensive one. enabling activities are never conducted for their own sake; their purpose is to enable or link other activities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operations and campaigns are unlikely to be conducted by a single Service or indeed by armed forces alone, and will most likely be multinational. Successful strategy requires more than military means; it depends on the cooperation of diplomatic, economic and military instruments of power, and the alignment of ends (objectives), ways (methods) and means (resources), underpinned by a compelling narrative. Land forces always seek to combine arms and will rarely work in isolation, more often supporting or being supported by air, maritime, special forces and logistic components as part of a joint force. Also, although the UK may choose to act alone, contemporary political and economic factors suggest that in most cases its forces are likely to operate as a contributing or lead nation, within an alliance or as part of an ad hoc coalition. They will often also work with regional or host nation partners. Most of the operations that land forces are likely to participate in, therefore, will require joint, inter-agency and multinational relationships. The joint force also consists of regular and reserve military personnel, civil servants and contractors, combined into a single team; this is described as the whole force approach. This section provides a summary of these four relationships. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The term joint describes an operation or organisation is one in which elements of at least two Services participate. More specifically, a joint operation is one where scalable maritime, land, air and special forces operate together within a single military force and/or command structure to achieve a specific mission or missions, in peace, war or crisis. A joint approach is one of the foundations of UK defence policy. Most campaigns in British military history have been joint; and contemporary national, NATO and coalition operations are all joint, structured according to the nature of the task. A joint approach combines capabilities to make each of them more effective. In operations this requires that maritime, land, air, special forces and logistic components are included in planning from the start. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In military terms, expeditionary campaigns are usually conducted by joint task forces (JTfs), created specifically for an operation. These may be national,
coalition or NATO JTfs. JTfs are tailored to a mission, and furnished with the capabilities necessary to achieve specified objectives. They are usually multinational and their titles differ depending on the alliance or coalition involved. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
 JTf headquarters plan and conduct the campaign at the operational level. Their subordinate force elements prosecute and coordinate battles and other tactical engagements to achieve operational level objectives. In larger scale operations, including major combat operations, a JTf will often exercise command through subordinate land, air, maritime, special forces and logistic components. This structure brings significant coherence to environmental activities, but land forces may not experience the same depth or proximity of joint cooperation as they might be accustomed to in a national or land-centric context. Indeed, in a land-centric campaign, command may be conducted by a JTf (Land), integrating the components within a single headquarters, alongside non-military actors and agencies. The JTf structure is designed to achieve the campaign objectives, rather than satisfy individual Service requirements. In both cases, the detail of the organisational structure is less important than the success of the campaign, which depends on a flexible approach to command and control. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Generally components work together through ‘supported/supporting’ relationships, maximising the overall effect of the joint force. A supported commander has primary responsibility for all aspects of a task or line of operations assigned by higher authority. A supporting commander provides augmentation or other support to a supported commander, or develops a supporting plan. Land forces always require support from the air component and may receive support from, or give support to, any component for particular joint objectives in a campaign. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Successful strategy requires an inter-agency approach to integrate the application of the military, economic and diplomatic instruments of power, at all levels of command and throughout the campaign. Ultimately states resort to the use of force when diplomatic and economic power cannot achieve the outcome required. When military power is used, it is in conjunction with the other two. It is, therefore, important to understand which agencies function at the operational level, how they will affect the tactical level, and the impact they will have on the conduct of operations. This inter-agency aspect of operations includes supranational organisations, for example the UN; UK government departments other than the Ministry of Defence, national intelligence agencies, host nation or other indigenous partners, non-governmental organisations, humanitarian groups, private security companies; and other contractors and commercial organisations. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
To engender effective inter-agency relationships, the UK government seeks to engender effective inter-agency relationships across all departments. This approach requires a culture of collaboration and cooperation as well as structures developed to enable shared understanding. Where activity cannot be synchronised or integrated it must be deconflicted. This is described through the Full spectrum Approach, which is also referred to in other government departments as the Integrated Approach. Similiarly, NATO doctrine describes a Comprehensive Approach in which military and non-military actors contribute with a shared purpose, based on a common sense of responsibility, openness and determination. This is facilitated by civil-military interaction which applies at the strategic, operational and tactical levels. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
By harnessing the three instruments of power, a full spectrum approach can increase tactical freedom. It applies expertise where and when it is needed to improve the prioritisation, synchronisation and coordination of activity. This approach can contribute to a sense of stability because when power is exercised in a civil context it creates perceptions of normality. There are also potential constraints hat can be caused by an integrated or full spectrum approach. There might be different perceptions of risk, competing resource priorities, language difficulties, differences in operating procedures, clashes of organisational culture, or variations in empowerment and operational objectives. even within a common strategy, all are potential sources of friction which could impact adversely on military activity and consequently broader operational outputs. Ultimately, the test of success lies not in the degree of cooperation, even though intrinsically valuable, but in the complete, integrated outcomes achieved through cooperation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Human relationships are decisive in making the approach work or fail. Underlying the approach is the common desire to achieve unity of effort and an acceptance that all three instruments of power are required for success. Military headquarters and their command posts, because they are usually relatively well-resourced and secure, can provide the physical means to enable a full spectrum approach.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although the UK retains the capability to conduct certain types of overseas operations independently, Defence policy is described as ‘international by design’. Multinational operations are the norm, whether in alliances, coalitions or partnerships with host nation forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Alliances exist between states for mutual benefits, which may be economic, diplomatic or military. Military alliances can be between individual countries or based on an alliance organisation, of which NATO is pre-eminent from the UK’s perspective. They seek to develop shared strength during peacetime, working and training together to build interoperability. Coalitions are formed as temporary alliances for common action by two or more nations, or based around an alliance like NATO. They will usually have an agreed lead nation. National policy envisages that most major overseas military operations involving UK land forces will be as part of a coalition that will probably be led by the United States. Coalitions and alliances bring mass, legitimacy and diplomatic power but also friction. Land forces must be ready to adapt to the requirements of a particular coalition. Although the stated purpose of an alliance or the action required by a coalition may be clear, nations join them for a range of reasons, explicit and unstated. Cooperation always has challenges, which are exacerbated when alliance or coalition members do not have matched motives and capabilities. In every case, national considerations will play out at the tactical level, requiring commanders and staff to understand partners’ considerations and to exercise diplomacy. There are, therefore, benefits and costs in joining coalitions and alliances:
a. Membership of a coalition or alliance provides many benefits, particularly diplomatic leverage to achieve international influence, not only to pursue a campaign but also to shape that campaign in the national interest. This benefit is broadly in proportion to the level of equity that a nation invests in the operation, with lead nations reaping the greatest potential reward. Membership also confers: representation in the coalition chain of command; unity and economy of effort, and a common purpose which adds to legitimacy and provides access to capability and mass; a sharing of risks; and a share of the benefits of a successful outcome from the campaign. Alliances and coalitions concentrate resources and provide a range of options which most nations could not generate independently.
b. Membership of a coalition or alliance means bearing a share of additional risks. It demands interoperability, the pursuit of which can be expensive and time-consuming. Membership can dilute national and military priorities. Coalitions may also include new allies with which the land force has not developed interoperability, requiring the force to adapt accordingly. Other costs include the need for consensus and a consequent reduction in freedoms. If a campaign goes badly, it is difficult to disengage from collective responsibility. The committal of resources to a coalition or alliance reduces the freedom to conduct other tasks. Burden sharing can also undermine the requirement for national military capabilities and versatile forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The extent of a force’s multinationality depends on a number of factors. The degree of interoperability is the foundation that governs what is achievable. However, the nature of the task is the deciding factor. Certain tasks are not achievable at certain levels unless interoperability is very high. Also, the more deeply a force is integrated, the more likely it is that a nation’s forces will come under the command of allied officers. Consequently, the higher the risks involved in tactical activity, the more likely it is that national chains will compete with, even supersede, multinational chains of command. This is also the case when the deployment is close to a nation’s strategic interests. This is why unit level multinationality is more common on peace support than it is on warfighting operations. The design of a force will depend on judgement, balancing the strategic benefits of the multinational arrangement with the tactical feasibility, limited by interoperability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
It is essential that joint, allied and coalition forces establish effective host nation partnerships. The degree of support offered to and by host nation governments and security forces is linked to its own political and social context as well as to the campaign itself. A host nation may provide access, overflight or staging facilitiesfor joint forces to and from the area of operations. Alternatively it may be within its territory that operations are conducted and it may provide military capability directly, including its own land forces. We may work with a host nation partner to help improve their external and internal security capability through direct or indirect capacity building. In all cases, the nature of the relationship with host nations is likely to be dynamic. They may exert their sovereignty in different ways during the campaign. Their motivations and political interests may evolve and will affect how joint forces conduct operations. Politics, culture, extant relationships, legitimacy and capabilities all affect the character of host nation partnerships. early engagement with and understanding of organisations with which land forces may operate is fundamental in forming effective partnerships. Defence engagement provides one aspect of this. Within a wider integrated or full spectrum approach, it sees land forces developing relationships with host nation security forces in peacetime, and during and after conflict.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The whole force approach concerns the appropriate mix of individual people within each group of Defence actors that contribute to operations. People are the defining attribute of land forces, whether organised as part of or alongside combined arms, joint or multinational formations. The operational challenges require people who are agile, adaptable and together have the full range of knowledge, skills and experience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The whole force approach places human capability at the heart of decision making, ensuring that outputs are delivered by the right mix of capable and motivated people. This mix might include regular and reserve service personnel, civil servants, other civilians (including local nationals) and contractors. This approach enables and requires land forces to draw on specialist expertise not normally held within regular military establishments. In addition to seeing civil servants embedded within land force structures, this may also include, for example, logisticians, cyber experts, or medics from either the reserve forces or as contractors. Contractor support to operations describes specific groups of contractors on deployed operations (referred to as CONDO), private security companies and sponsored reserves.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The mix of individuals varies from operation to operation. forces at very high readiness usually comprise mostly regular personnel, while forces engaged on more enduring stabilisation operations contain a broader mix. At the same time, the blurring of previous distinctions between domestic and overseas operations and threats means that a whole force approach is as relevant and necessary in the UK as in the deployed force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In the same way that relationships with multinational and joint partners are improved through mutual understanding, working and training together, the whole force approach will also benefit. Civilians and contractors work under different terms and conditions to regular and reserve personnel. Their flexibility and security requirements will vary, as will the assurance of their input.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The context of operations informs the enduring contributions that land forces make to strategy and joint operations. UK land forces can:
a. integrate the effects of national instruments of power in the land environment;
b. defeat enemy land forces;
c. secure and hold terrain objectives, including access to areas of operations;
d. directly influence the behaviours of conflict actors, in conjunction with other instruments of power;
e. enable other Services, instruments of power, partners and agencies to operate, including through providing security, tactical understanding and interpersonal relationships;
f. represent strong political commitment in support of national, alliance, coalition or bilateral objectives, complementary to other instruments of power;
g. deter hostile and potentially hostile actors from aggression, as part of a credible and capable joint force;
h. support the civil authorities in providing of homeland resilience and security; and
i. support conflict prevention and security improvement through persistent engagement and capacity building.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
fighting Power is a concept that describes the operational effectiveness of armed forces, or any element of them. Common across Defence and NATO, the concept guides force development and preparation. This chapter explains the contextual characteristics of fighting Power, and then describes its three components: conceptual, moral and physical. See figure <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The conceptual component is the force’s knowledge, understanding and application of doctrine – the ideas behind how to operate and fight – kept relevant by its ability to learn and adapt. The moral component is the force’s morale, leadership and ethical conduct: the ability to get people to operate and fight and to do so appropriately. The physical component consists of manpower, equipment, sustainability and resources: the means to operate and fight. Training is considered as part of the physical component, although it develops and integrates all three components. The three components are interdependent. In some circumstances, one component can be more important than the others. The level of fighting Power is closely connected to readiness: the more complete all the elements are, the higher the level of readiness. The fighting Power of a force element relies on the overall fighting Power of its Service, and on its ability to provide the necessary institutional support.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The fighting Power of a Service or force must be adaptable if it is to be effective on operations. A force must be balanced, able to start the operation at the appropriate time and place, able to continue for as long as is necessary, and be large enough for the task. These requirements point to readiness, deployability, and the capacity, if necessary, for endurance. The nature of the task or campaign will indicate the scale of force required, but it may be necessary to generate mass: to expand armed forces for unforeseen circumstances, as the UK did in the world wars and for the Korean War. Beyond the requirements of readiness, deployability, duration and mass, the force must be adapted to the context of each unique operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
fighting Power is in some respects a relative as well as an absolute concept. for example, certain forces may be assessed as having high and balanced fighting Power, but be fundamentally unsuited for the task. So fighting Power is inherently contextual, determined by how well a force (our own, allied or enemy) is adapted to the character of the operation in which it is engaged. Certain contextual characteristics inform assessment of fighting Power:
a. Assessment of fighting Power is both quantitative and qualitative. Much of the physical component can be quantitatively measured. This constitutes the visible combat power of a force and informs force ratio assessments, and so contributes
to understanding relative capabilities. On the other hand, the moral and conceptual components tend more to subjective, qualitative assessment. The three components are interdependent, although which, if any, is pre-eminent depends on the situation.
b. Military effectiveness is measured not against an absolute standard; rather it is relative and competitive in nature. Comparison to and understanding of the fighting Power of other relevant actors provides the essential reference points by which land forces’ fighting Power can be assessed and adapted in a given situation.
c. The environment in which land forces are used and for which they are prepared also has a significant bearing on their actual fighting Power. Given the uncertainty of where, against whom and with whom operations might be conducted, land forces require mental and physical preparation to operate in a range of environments. A force optimised to fight and operate in a single environment may not have the appropriate balance of fighting Power to operate elsewhere. When fighting Power is developed to deal with the complexities of the most demanding operational environments, a force increases its potential to adapt rapidly to new situations.
d. In contemporary operations, the fighting Power of UK land forces is dependent on effective interoperability with other Services, allies, partners and agencies. The moral component is strengthened through human interoperability, the physical through technical interoperability, and the conceptual through procedural interoperability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The conceptual component of fighting Power rests on the development and application of doctrine. As the intellectual basis of fighting Power, it guides the physical and moral components. Deficits in the conceptual component, for example through misunderstanding, or insufficient flexibility, severely damage a force’s overall fighting Power, even if the will and means to fight are well developed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The conceptual component is as important to routine military activity as it is to operations, providing the corporate mental agility, intellectual rigour and creativity required to adapt quickly. This section describes two elements of the conceptual component particularly relevant in an operational context: understanding how to operate, and the flexibility by which a land force can adapt.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding how to operate, the basis of the conceptual component, requires understanding of a given situation and knowledge of the relevant doctrine. Understanding is the perception and interpretation of a particular situation to provide the context, insight and foresight required for effective decision making. To operate effectively in complex situations, land forces must develop understanding of the nature and character of conflict and its context. This understanding, constantly refined through education and experience, not only ensures that the doctrine used is relevant and useable, but also that it can be applied pragmatically, rather than by prescription. See Annex 8A for further detail on understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Doctrine is defined as a set of fundamental principles by which military forces guide their actions in support of objectives. It is authoritative but requires judgement in application. Doctrine is a formal expression of military knowledge and thought that the British Army accepts as being relevant at a given time. Agile, not dogmatic, it takes past experience and extracts guidance for dealing with future challenges, providing a foundation from which initiative can be applied with confidence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As doctrine underpins all military activity, it is the basis for education and training. UK land forces doctrine is founded on joint and NATO doctrine. Where there are deviations from this, they must be clearly communicated to all involved. The language and terminology used in doctrine must be precise, clear, and formally agreed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Doctrine is broadly categorised as either higher or lower level, as illustrated in figure 3-2:
a. Higher-level doctrine establishes the philosophy and principles that underpin the approach to military activity. It provides a framework for the employment of the military instrument and a foundation for its practical application. While it is in part prescriptive, it is mostly descriptive. Higher level NATO and joint doctrine is contained in the Allied Joint Publication and Joint Doctrine Publication series respectively. If NATO doctrine differs significantly from UK joint doctrine, UK either retains a national JDP or adds national ‘green pages’ to the AJP, referred to as a ‘hybrid’ publication. Army Doctrine Publication Land Operations is the British Army’s higher level doctrine, also referred to as capstone doctrine for land forces.
b. Lower-level doctrine focuses on the practices and procedures required for the effective employment of military forces. It is more prescriptive than higher-level doctrine and at its lowest levels includes instructions for specific drills. NATO lower-level doctrine for land forces is found in the Allied Tactical Publication series. for UK land forces, the equivalents are the Army field Manual series (of thematic, environmental and functional doctrine), tactical aides-memoire, handbooks, and standard operating procedures and instructions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
effective doctrine is accessible, credible and relevant. This requires engaging with three groups in its development: writers, teachers and practitioners. It is the responsibility of commanders not only to understand and apply doctrine, but to impart understanding to their subordinates, as well as to recommend improvements to those who write it. Doctrine is reviewed and refreshed as required to account for evolving strategic direction, emerging doctrine (from both higher and lower levels), the changing character of conflict and relevant lessons from experimentation, training and operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The second essential element of the conceptual component is the flexibility to adapt to deal with complex, dynamic challenges. flexibility spans all components of fighting Power, but is guided by the conceptual component. A dogmatic and rigid conceptual component stifles the opportunities presented by organisational versatility. A flexible conceptual component can enable the whole force to adapt with confidence in the face of uncertainty and in competition with adversaries, when whoever adapts most effectively is more likely to prevail.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
History is full of examples of military forces that have either successfully adapted or failed to do so. Land forces that are successful in adaptation require, though not exclusively: the right command and cognitive skills across the force; a broad, flexible doctrine; the ability to identify and learn lessons; organisational and technical flexibility; and broad-based preparation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Firstly, land forces require the command and cognitive skills to be flexible and adaptable. essential to all aspects of flexibility is a military culture that supports and nurtures mental agility and initiative. The British Army’s command philosophy, Mission Command, promotes decentralised command, freedom and speed of action, and initiative. Mission Command not only encourages but also demands that subordinates use their initiative. It is through initiative and a culture of mutual trust providing a safe environment for open analysis of shortfalls that a land force learns lessons, and adopts innovative approaches to complex challenges. Initiative draws strength from experience and realistic training. It also draws strength through understanding of doctrine, military education and a questioning mindset across the whole force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Secondly, a broad doctrine provides a common foundation on which land forces can build when faced with potentially new situations. Although the principles of doctrine endure, tactics, techniques and procedures need to evolve rapidly, adapting to the specific situation. A land force can only gain meaningful understanding when it has actually engaged on an operation. It can then generate lessons from the operational theatre, enabling its own rapid adaptation, that of follow on forces, and longer term institutional level force development.
a. Lessons are experiences, examples, or developed observations that impart beneficial new knowledge or wisdom for the future. Lessons can be identified through historical study, training, operations and the experiences of other forces. An effective lessons capability depends on a military culture that strives for continuous improvement, encouraging enquiry into and examination of what has gone well and what has not. fundamental to this culture are leaders who engage directly and openly in the process, with humility, trust and a willingness to learn.
b. The supporting lessons process requires a staff structure and information management and exploitation tools. The process initially comprises lessons capture and analysis of observations and insights, resulting in lessons identification. The lessons identified are assigned to those responsible for remedial action. There are two ways by which a lesson is described as being learned. The first is when validated implementation of the remedial action results in improved operational performance and capability. The second is when identification of best practice is widely communicated and exploited.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Thirdly, the land force requires organisational and technological flexibility. A balance of capabilities across the land force, plans for regeneration and constant innovation together aid flexibility. A balanced force includes the appropriate mix of force elements (combat, combat support, and combat service support), force types, specialist capabilities, and individuals (the whole force approach). If the force is not ideally balanced, the risk can be partially mitigated by exploiting synergies with allies and other Services. Robust and realistic plans for the regeneration of capabilities also contribute to the potential adaptability of the force. flexibility can also be enabled by the innovative use of current and emerging capabilities and technologies. While innovation can require specialist expertise, it can also come from, for example, wargaming and scenario based planning. The success of the German Army’s innovation in the 1920s demonstrates the potential of such an approach.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Finally, adaptable land forces conduct realistic broad-based preparation through military education and training. Although we cannot predict the future, rigorous analysis, lessons from our own and others’ experiences, education and concept development can indicate many characteristics of the conflicts likely to be faced. Realistic and demanding training to develop core skills, based on doctrine and supported by effective lessons processes, underpins the successful adaptation of land forces. Learning from history – German Army 1920-30s Under the 1919 Treaty of Versailles, the German army (Reichsheer) had to be reorganised. It was limited to 100,000 men, of whom only 4000 could be officers, and it was not allowed to have heavy or modern equipment. As its chief from 1919, General Hans Von Seeckt implemented the changes and instituted a major programme to examine the lessons of the first World War. The first experiments on mechanization and mobility were carried out in 1921 and the lessons from these were widely distributed throughout the army. foreign writings on military theory (such as by fuller, Liddell-Hart and Martel) were translated into German and studied and debated. The review of lessons, the experimentation and study led to the promulgation in 1933 of a coherent and realistic doctrine (Truppenführung) – that emphasised combined arms manoeuvre; close air support; decentralized command and control; and rapid exploitation. The 100,000 were trained as the leadership cadre of a much larger army. In the 1930s Germany used dummy tanks (plywood hulls mounted on a truck chassis) and other ways of experimenting, training and refining their tactics. This allowed them to continue the process of force development without causing the major powers to intervene. Rapid expansion followed soon after Hitler came to power in 1933, but the foundation for the early, shattering successes of the Wehrmacht in the Second World War was laid by the conceptual preparation of Seeckt’s Reichsheer.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The moral component concerns the human aspect of fighting Power. It consists of three mutually dependent elements, described in turn in this section: morale is the will of the force and its soldiers to fight; leadership is the essential element of morale, inculcates the ethical foundation, and directs the force across all three components of fighting Power; and the ethical, moral and legal foundation underpins the way in which land forces conduct operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The moral component is easily corrupted. To be sound, its three elements must be strong and balanced. A force can have high morale, be willing and able to fight very effectively, but if its actions are not legitimate, it risks becoming like the Waffen SS in the Second World War. Such forces can never be the instrument of a democracy. Likewise, when a force’s ethical, moral and legal foundations are sound, but its leadership or morale is weak and it will not fight, it is at best useless, at worst a danger to the wider force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Morale, the first element, resides at the heart of fighting Power. Maintenance of Morale is a Principle of War because high morale enables the land force to fight and overcome the privations of conflict. High morale is possible without an ethical foundation, but this would be ultimately self-defeating for the land forces of a democratic country. Indeed, the morale of the land force is strengthened by its moral integrity and legitimacy. Morale is not a discrete entity, but is the product of the synergy of all three components of fighting Power. Of the many contributory factors to morale, which include the Army’s Values
and Standards, seven stand out and are described below. These are mutually supporting and developed most effectively through leadership and challenging, realistic training.
a. Fighting spirit unifies all who serve in our armed forces. Comprising initiative, courage, resilience, determination and toughness, fighting spirit drives soldiers forward in the most arduous and adverse of conditions. Through fighting spirit, soldiers accept both the legal right and duty to apply lethal force, and also the potentially unlimited liability to lay down their lives in the service of the nation. fighting spirit requires moral and physical fortitude. By testing fighting spirit in demanding training, it is hardened and made more resilient to the realities of potentially brutal land conflict.
b. Moral cohesion is the sense of shared identity and a determined purpose that gives a force the will to fight and succeed. Cohesion binds individuals into teams, and teams into effective fighting forces. Strong moral cohesion makes forces emotionally resilient in adversity. It also helps to make individuals more likely to use their initiative and exploit opportunities, because they will be confident of the support of their comrades and unit or formation. The nature of conflict puts significant pressure on moral cohesion, but without it, the force is susceptible to shock and collapse. Leadership enhances moral cohesion by building shared identity and values. Individual friendships and collective bonding grow when teams are kept together over time, developing a sense of belonging. Common experiences and histories strengthen comradeship and pride. Together, these build identity, ethos and cause, which individuals can value even above their own lives.
c. Discipline underpins fighting spirit and moral cohesion. It is the glue that holds soldiers together when threatened; it is the primary antidote to fear. When discipline is sound, commanders can be confident that their orders will be carried out, and soldiers know that their commanders and comrades will not let them down. Commanders
at all levels are responsible for maintaining discipline in terms of obedience to the
law, regulations, orders, instructions, procedures and standards. The best discipline, however, is self-discipline. Commanders must be confident that their subordinates will strive to do their duty under the worst conditions of war, and do so with initiative and intelligence.
d. Comradeship is the basis of moral cohesion and the wider morale of the land force. Land conflict is ultimately a human activity conducted by groups of people, whose comradeship gives them the friendship and mutual trust necessary to endure and overcome danger, fear and privation. Honed on operations, comradeship is forged in the common bonds developed between individuals and teams working, training, living and socialising together. Comradeship embraces former comrades-in-arms and the families of soldiers, often making units families themselves.
e. Pride in oneself, one’s unit, Service, country and cause can be a potent moral force. As a sense of worthy achievement, pride inspires individuals and teams to the greatest heights of sacrifice and valour. It also generates a common goal of avoiding shame
by doing the right thing, upholding the ethical foundation and abiding by the Values and Standards. Pride without arrogance brings people from the widest variety of backgrounds together, strengthening the ties of moral cohesion.
f. Confidence and trust placed in the equipment and sustainment of the physical component are also instrumental to morale. Living conditions, rations, ammunition, vehicles, weapons, communications, and medical support, for example, all underpin morale. The nature of land conflict means that a disconnect between expectations and reality is inevitable, but a force with high morale and strong leadership can usually overcome this. However, when failures in equipment or sustainment become or are perceived to be systemic, unnecessary or irreversible, morale suffers.
g. field Marshal Slim concluded that “only spiritual foundations can withstand real strain”. The spiritual foundation relates to belief in a cause, which may be religious, cultural or political. In the same way as the ethical and legal foundations of the moral component require nurturing and protection, so will the spiritual foundations. Spiritual support comes in many forms. It is provided by chaplains and lay persons in units, by families and wider social networks, and by strong leadership, developing shared belief in the cause to be fought for.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Leadership is the central element of the moral component; it is so important to morale and the whole conduct of operations that it is treated as a separate subject. Land forces rely completely on the strength of their leadership at all levels, from the force commander to the most junior non-commissioned officers. Leadership is not, however, constrained solely to the chain of command or to those of rank; anyone, including private soldiers, can motivate those around them through initiative, example and courage. In battle, it is leaders who break the paralysis of shock amid fear, uncertainty, death and destruction. Their vision, intellect, communication and unceasing motivation paves the path through chaos and confusion. They inspire the force through boldness, courage, personal example, compassion and resolute determination to win. Then, and at all other times, it is leaders who shape and control the conduct of the force, for good or ill.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Leadership, therefore, is the critical element of the moral component, vital to the success of operations, particularly in their darkest moments. It is also the cornerstone of command, as the trust and mutual understanding engendered by good leadership are central to Mission Command. It is instrumental in inculcating the ethical, moral and legal foundation of the force. Leadership provides the inspiration, purpose and direction to the development and protection of all components of fighting Power. Bad leadership, often masked in the hierarchy of land forces, has far reaching and damaging effects. It rapidly demoralises and destabilises a land force and its combat effectiveness.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Army Leadership Doctrine exists because land operations and the nature of land forces require a distinctive approach to leadership. Leadership on operations is conducted in a challenging context, which, because of the nature of conflict, is sometimes at the extremes of human experience. It is constrained by doctrine and policy (for example levels of authority), orders, and the ethical, moral and legal foundation of the force. It is important to understand three particular elements of operational leadership.
a. Land forces have to be deeply hierarchical, with leaders (commanders) appointed
to the lowest levels. The adversarial and human characteristics of operations place particular demands on leadership in the land force, requiring it to be developed in and exercised by all ranks. fostering junior leadership and initiative at all levels enables Mission Command.
b. Leaders at all levels establish the command culture and climate of the force and any element of it. If either culture or climate is inappropriate, it damages morale, and therefore operational effectiveness. Culture is relatively stable and enduring, and is established by senior leaders whose attitudes and behaviours shape that of the wider force. Climate is more specific, susceptible to change and heavily influenced by lower level leadership. It is most relevant in smaller groups, such as at unit level and below. Leaders of all ranks must establish an appropriate climate and culture that promotes and is consistent with the Army’s Values and Standards.
c. UK land forces’ reputation for and practice of good leadership is vital to operational success. We remain a reference point, domestically and internationally, for leadership throughout the force. Because campaign authority includes how the members of the force conduct themselves, collectively and individually, it is essential to maintain the reality that underpins this reputation. The reputation, built over a long time, is therefore a key factor of our operational effectiveness, but it is easily damaged by bad leadership and misconduct.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Army Leadership Doctrine explains what is expected of leaders on operations and in all other activity. It explains the Army Leadership framework (what leaders are/know/do), the Army Leadership Model (the three roles and six functions) and the Army Leadership Code. The key operational requirement is for good practice of British Army leadership to be translated into good practice by those in command, and for it to be adopted by all ranks.
a. The Army Leadership Framework explains the characteristics of leaders. ‘What leaders are’ is about integrity, example and personal impact. Leaders set the example as role models, accept responsibility and are able to influence people and events. They routinely apply and promote the British Army’s Values and Standards and in all situations. Leaders care about the people they lead, the example they set, their own leadership and the Army’s Values and Standards. ‘What leaders know’ is about professional competence. It is grounded in the fact that leaders are soldiers first and foremost, and should be experts in their technical field. In the operational context it requires, for example, thorough understanding of doctrine, the context of operations, and higher commanders intent. ‘What leaders do’ is about translating values and competence into action. Leaders develop the individuals under their command, and build effective teams. But above all, they lead their people to achieve their tasks.
b. the Army Leadership Model describes the generic role of a leader performing three interdependent roles: achieving the task, building teams and developing individuals. Obviously highly relevant to operations, the leader requires contextual understanding and has six further leadership functions: defining the task, planning, communicating, executing, supporting and evaluating.
c. the Army Leadership Code consists of seven behaviours that define how Army leaders should lead. It assists them in translating Values and Standards into action and reminds them of the desired leadership behaviours.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The third element of the moral component is the ethical, moral and legal foundation. To be effective, a force’s actions must reflect a sound and appropriate ethical, moral and legal foundation, and be perceived as such by the audience. If they are not, campaign authority will be undermined, reducing, if not removing, the opportunity to translate tactical military success into desired political outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The actions of land forces are guided by their obligations as soldiers and an ethical foundation shared with that of UK society. These ideas inform two of the Army’s values – selfless commitment and respect for others. This ethical foundation is based on the concept of inalienable natural rights, granted not by a particular government or culture, but universal and non-negotiable. Modern Western liberal democracy emerged from the belief that every individual has the natural right to life and liberty. from these natural rights stem three moral principles. first, everyone in the world is morally equal, including before the law. The second principle is that of intrinsic, individual moral dignity: a person’s status is defined not by what they do, but by the fact that they are human beings. Third, everyone has moral worth, residing in their potential. While always acting lawfully, land forces apply these principles in their engagement with other people, in conflict and non-conflict situations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
However, UK soldiers have responsibilities to the country and their comrades not expected of other parts of society, and voluntarily place their inalienable right to life and liberty behind that of service to the nation. They must be prepared to accept risk to their own lives, and they are required when necessary to use lethal force. To ensure they conduct themselves appropriately, they must comply with the Army’s Values and Standards and fulfil their commitment as part of the mutual obligation of the military covenant.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The practical expression of the Army’s ethical foundation are the Army’s values and standards that guide the conduct of every soldier. They are a fundamental part of morale. Operational effectiveness and the reputation of land forces depend on the ability of every individual to demonstrate absolute professionalism in the most intense of circumstances. Adversaries and enemies will seek to manipulate situations and our understanding to not only test our resolve, but also our ethical foundation. Our Values and Standards are the practical code that fulfils this foundation. The Values of courage, discipline, respect for others, integrity, loyalty and selfless commitment together guide our actions. They define who we are as individual servicemen and women and collectively as a land force. The Standards define the manner in which serving personnel are required to behave in every aspect and dimension of their life, professional and private. They demand that our actions are lawful, appropriate and totally professional. The Army’s Values and Standards publication provides a detailed and authoritative explanation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Service personnel are bound by service to the country in what is effectively a mutual military covenant. This arrangement is inherently unequal in that they may have to contribute more than they receive: their liability is total. In putting the needs of the country, society and their comrades before their own, they forgo some of the rights and freedoms enjoyed by their fellow citizens. In return, UK service personnel should be able to expect the country, and their commanders, to provide them with the necessary resources and leadership to: achieve the objectives required of them; treat them fairly; value and respect them as individuals; support their families; and provide long term support, should they need it, during and after their service. As a covenant, it imposes moral rather than contractual obligations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The physical component of fighting Power provides the means to fight. Comprising principally manpower, equipment, training, sustainability and resources (MeTS-R), it is also referred to as the combat power of a force. Manpower and equipment are converted into ready, deployable forces by training. Training, although described within the physical component, has an essential part in the development of fighting Power as a whole, building the moral and conceptual components as much as the physical.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The fighting Power of a land force is founded on its people – manpower. The Army’s ability to attract, recruit and retain the right people, with the right skills, in the right quantity and at the right time is critical to its fighting Power. Land forces require soldiers who are ready and prepared, individually and collectively. UK land forces also demand that soldiers place the needs of the Service above their own. Manpower is, therefore, absolutely dependent on the moral component if it is to be effective and sustainable. It also relies on the conceptual component to ensure required knowledge and skills. This pool of manpower does not consist solely of soldiers, regular or reserve, but also of civil servants, other civilians and contractors. each will come with differing terms of service, experiences, requirements and expectations that must be accounted for in forming a cohesive and effective land force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces require sufficient and effective equipment, designed, manufactured and scaled according to the likely or directed operational requirement. equipment can be operational or non-operational, deployable or non-deployable. equipment care is the responsibility of all soldiers to ensure that equipment is serviceable for use on operations and training and money is not wasted.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Equipment programmes follow a cycle of concept, assessment, demonstration, manufacture, in-service use and disposal. This process can be time and resource intensive and may not be sufficiently responsive to the needs of an adaptable land force. Alternative procurement methods exist through the urgent capability requirement process, but these can be expensive. The Army, therefore, seeks to reduce the difference between programmed and urgent procurement. This requires first an understanding of the nature and character of conflict and of doctrine. It also depends on a coherent research and development programme between the UK Government and industry, experimentation, and operational analysis. Additionally, harnessing initiative, creativity and innovation through lessons processes improves the equipment availability of the force and identifies novel ways of adapting its use.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Training is the essential vehicle by which all three components of fighting Power are developed. force preparation relies on a structured training progression, tailored to the operating context, tempo and the resources available. The overall progression begins with turning recruits into soldiers. They are then trained in a specific role, individually and as part of a team. The team is trained to be a coherent part of a sub-unit. The sub-unit is then trained to operate within a combined arms grouping; the combined arms grouping is then trained within a formation context. Once in units, through the progression soldiers develop interoperability not only with other arms and Services but also allied nations. This continuous flow can be divided into individual and collective training. These two elements are best delivered separately to avoid training a force of individuals, at a time when that force needs to be training as a whole. Training continues during operational deployments, not only to maintain core skills, but as part of adaptation, so the force can employ new tactics, techniques and procedures, and use new equipment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
AfM Training provides guidance on how to plan and conduct training in accordance with prioritised direction given by higher headquarters. The principles of training reflect the cumulative experience of many military generations and form the bedrock of the Army’s approach to training.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As people are the foundation of a land force’s fighting Power, training is designed around individuals first. Intimately related to education, individual training provides the essential skills needed to conduct operational tasks as a soldier, apply trade skills in the field and operate as part of a team. Physical fitness, shooting and fieldcraft are the essential foundation of military skills for all soldiers, but are insufficient for contemporary operations. Other skills are required, such as the ability to access and use information, and to communicate and cooperate with allies, partners and other actors in the area of operations. Individual training is delivered after recruitment, and continues throughout careers, building upon special- to-arm expertise. This is essential for the maintenance and development of military skills, as they quickly fade if they are not practised. Individual training is one of the first responsibilities of commanders; they should ensure that standards are maintained by, among other things, a cycle of annual skills testing. Strong collective performances are based on strong individual capabilities, and weaknesses in collective performance can often be traced to gaps or weaknesses in individual training.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Collective training is the iterative process by which competent individuals are gradually forged into teams of increasing size, complexity and capability. A force is not ready for operations until it has undergone robust and realistic collective training, to training objectives and conditions consistent with the operational requirement. Collective training seeks to replicate, through simulation and field training, the challenges of complex operations. The primary purposes of forms of collective training vary, but each complements the others. Collective training builds competence over time, beginning with low level team skills, through special-to-arm and combined arms to joint training. Commanders and staff at all levels participate in command training.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Collective training is described as either foundation or mission specific training. The collective skills developed are not bound to a single category; rather this description informs the purpose and resourcing of the training conducted. foundation training develops the flexible core competences of the land force, providing it with a firm foundation from which to adapt to specific operational situations. It takes account of how the operating environment might change or broaden as well the unchanging aspects of the nature of conflict. foundation training seeks to replicate high-intensity, complex warfighting. It reflects the nature and character of conflict, the austerity of expeditionary campaigns, and the requirement to fight in both the physical and virtual domains, with, against and among multiple actors and in view of the rest of the audience. Mission specific training then addresses inevitable shortfalls in foundation training, and enables a unit’s adaptation to meet its specific, intended mission. Mission specific training continues both on arrival in a theatre of operations and during deployment, ensuring that the force trains in the most current and relevant tactics, techniques and procedures.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
education contributes, in parallel with training, to the development of fighting Power as a whole. Training without education will not be sufficiently sophisticated to deal with the complexity of conflict and operations. education without training does not prepare people to apply the theory. Military education equips individuals with the breadth and depth of knowledge and skills to assume greater responsibility and increase their employability. Courses, academic placements and private study are examples. The adaptability of land forces depends on continuous investment in, encouragement of and reward for appropriate education. Most importantly, education gives people the intellectual edge and confidence to improvise, innovate and find solutions to problems which do not fit the contingency expected.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
sustainability is essential: even if the force is fully manned and has all the necessary equipment, if it cannot be sustained, it cannot be employed as intended. Sustainment also underpins the path from force preparation to deployment. This encompasses the sustainability of individuals and teams, of training, and of infrastructure and training space so that soldiers can live and train together in suitable conditions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The physical component is also reliant on wider resources. Manning, equipping, training and sustaining armed forces costs money. Ultimately, if there are insufficient resources available on and between operations to recruit, train, equip, deploy and sustain the force, fighting Power is severely undermined.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fighting Power can only be applied if the force is held at the appropriate readiness, can be deployed in time, and then recovered for the next operation. forces are generally held at readiness, or notice to move, from their home base or a mounting centre in the UK. A force at 6 months notice to move, for example, needs that time to train and gather the necessary resources to complete its fighting Power. Notice to effect is largely dependent on the resources, including time, required to deploy and be ready for employment. Readiness applies to all components of fighting Power: conceptual readiness reflects the required understanding and intellectual readiness to adapt to expected and unexpected contingencies; moral readiness is represented by the leadership and morale of the force; and physical readiness by the physical state of the force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The deployability and recovery of the force requires internal and usually external, including joint, enablers. for example, the joint force may enable the deployment of a land force to a point of disembarkation from which it may need to project itself overland for hundreds of kilometres. These factors must be accounted for when considering the readiness and overall military effectiveness of a land force. enabling actions include: pre-deployment leave; reception, staging, onward movement and integration (RSOI); the relief in place of the in-place force; extraction and recovery; decompression; and post-operational tour leave.
<|endoftext|>

Part 1 described the nature and character of conflict, and the implications for land forces. These indicate a need for doctrine that addresses the increasing global flow and availability of information as well as the enduring human, adversarial and political nature of conflict. This doctrine is integrated Action – the application of the full range of lethal and non-lethal capabilities to change and maintain the understanding and behaviour of audiences to achieve a successful outcome. It is a unifying doctrine which guides the orchestration and execution of operations whether the task is any combination of fighting, engagement, security or support. In particular it provides the conceptual framework for land forces to succeed in an interconnected world where information is pervasive. While only formations at the higher tactical level and above are routinely resourced and structured to orchestrate Integrated Action, it governs the way of thinking about all operations, and informs how they are executed. Integrated Action is explained in Chapter 4. Integrated Action is supported by the tenets of the Manoeuvrist Approach and Mission Command. The application or threat of lethal force in accordance with the Manoeuvrist Approach, explained in Chapter 5, is central to combat operations. The Manoeuvrist Approach is an attitude of mind that seeks indirect approaches in applying strength against the vulnerabilities of the enemy. It is the British Army’s fighting doctrine for the tactical level, specifically focused on the enemy. It is a particularly important aspect of Integrated Action as combat operations can have far reaching effects at the operational and strategic levels. Mission Command, the subject of Chapter 6, is our command philosophy. It emphasises decentralised command, empowers leaders down to the lowest level, and makes them responsible for acting to achieve their commander’s intent within designated constraints. Integrated Action guides the land contribution to joint and multinational operations. It is consistent with the UK doctrine of Joint Action. Integrated Action and Joint Action are also consistent with NATO operational and tactical doctrines. These emphasise the military contribution to an inter-agency full spectrum approach through the orchestration of the NATO joint functions. Together, Integrated Action, the Manoeuvrist Approach and Mission Command form the fundamental ideas of UK land forces’ doctrine. The Chapters that follow in Part 2 provide the intellectual foundation for Part 3, which introduces how operations are conducted and provides the capstone for the AfM series.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated Action describes how land forces orchestrate and execute operations in an interconnected world, where the consequences of military action are judged by an audience that extends from immediate participants to distant observers. Integrated Action requires commanders and staff to be clear about the outcome that they are seeking and analyse the audience relevant to the attainment of their objectives. They then identify the effects that they wish to impart on that audience to achieve the outcome, and what capabilities and actions are available. These lethal and non-lethal capabilities may belong to the land force itself, or to joint, inter-governmental, inter-agency, non- governmental, private sector and multinational actors involved in the operation. What is important is for commanders and staff to work out how to synchronise and orchestrate all the relevant levers to impart effects onto the audience to achieve the outcome.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated Action, with the audience as its major consideration, requires sophisticated understanding, integration of all capabilities available, and is outcome-focused. These are the four fundamentals of the doctrine. Within land forces, the tactical functions are the primary levers of influence.
a. People are at the heart of conflict; it is their decisions and behaviours that determine how conflict is conducted and resolved. Integrated Action requires consideration of the diverse audience that is relevant to the attainment of our objectives, globally, nationally and within theatres of operations.
b. Integrated Action is founded on the land force’s understanding of its task and environment. A dynamic approach to understanding, built on a learning culture, allows the force to adapt and innovate in response to evolving situations.
c. Land forces create desired effects by the integration of lethal and non-lethal capabilities. effective integration relies on the cooperation and interoperability of the land force, multinational, host nation, inter-governmental, non-governmental and inter-agency partners, as well as of tactical combined arms formations and units.
d. Integrated Action needs commanders to think about how their actions contribute to the desired outcomes, in a broad and evolving context. This approach encourages a wider and longer-term view of a situation, relative to the task and role of the land force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
This chapter explains how these fundamentals of Integrated Action are put into practice. The first section describes what land forces need to understand, with the priority being the human aspect of the land environment – the audience. The second section introduces how the land force integrates lethal and non-lethal capabilities to achieve desired outcomes. The chapter concludes with three examples.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The doctrine of Integrated Action applies at all levels to land forces, from the land component of the joint operation, to tactical formations, units and sub-units. There is, however, an important delineation between responsibilities for its orchestration and execution.
a. It is only at the higher tactical or operational level (usually the division or corps) that Integrated Action can be orchestrated and fully aligned with joint, inter-agency and multinational operations. In certain circumstances, brigades or units may be the highest level of UK land command in a particular theatre and so may be required to operate at the operational level. examples include conducting capacity building or non- combatant evacuation operations. In such cases, they must be resourced appropriately.
b. Brigades and units at the tactical level plan and execute their contributions to Integrated Action. They routinely integrate their capabilities and activities to deliver single tactical actions, as part of a longer term higher tactical or operational level plan.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Central to Integrated Action is analysis and understanding of the audience relevant to the attainment of our objectives. We must also develop understanding of the information and physical aspects of the operating environment, and of the context and consequences of our actions. However, no amount of analysis can achieve complete understanding in advance of an operation; and predictable relationships between cause and effect are rare in adversarial human conflict. Therefore, it is essential to set the force to learn throughout an operation, generating dynamic and continuous understanding. This will require specific planned effort, to collect and analyse information to test deductions, and to refine decisions as to future action.
a. The audience is made up of all the groups and individual people whose perception and interpretation of events and subsequent behaviour contribute to the success or otherwise of military action. These groups range from the global audience right down to immediate participants, as illustrated in figure 1.
b. Within the wider audience are actors – those individuals or groups who take action or directly exert influence. They include our own forces and allies, as well as others who are friendly, neutral or hostile to us. Although the audience and actors are not constrained geographically, tactical level land forces are primarily concerned with changing or maintaining the behaviour of actors within an area of operations, while promoting the consent of the wider audience. These local actors, ranging from armed groups to non-governmental and private sector organisations, may be, or have the potential to be supportive, neutral or hostile.
c. Adversaries are a sub-set of actors; they seek to prevent us from achieving our objectives. They may have many different motivations and may be subject to a broad range of influences. Adversaries will often present hybrid threats, combining the threat or application of armed force with deniable or ambiguous actions that may not cross the threshold of armed conflict.
d. An enemy is a particular kind of adversary, who seeks to oppose us through armed, lethal means. The boundaries between these groups are not fixed. for example, adversaries may be persuaded or elect to become neutral or even friendly actors. Conversely, the unintended consequences of our actions may see previously neutral actors become our enemies. It is important to identify how groups and individuals relate to each other, what motivates and influences them, how they can influence us and how land forces might seek to achieve advantageous behavioural outcomes while preventing those that are undesirable.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders must also understand the information aspects of the land environment: how it can influence the audience, and how, as a resource of the land force, it supports the integration of actions. As a means of influence, we must understand what information is relevant and, to whom, how it is received, and how it might influence people’s decision-making and behaviours. We must also understand how we and other actors compete for influence by using information, in both the physical and virtual domains. Information is also a fundamental resource of land forces, our partners and adversaries. It is generated, maintained and transferred primarily in the virtual domain, which will be contested and potentially denied by adversaries.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding how we and others operate in the virtual domain informs how we protect our own information, and how we might challenge our adversaries. We seek information superiority, but must be able to operate without it. Understanding the physical geography of the land environment underpins the effective integration of physical actions, such as manoeuvre and fires, with other levers of influence, for example, information activities or those delivered by other instruments of power. first, we must understand the military relevance of the terrain, both as an objective of land operations and as the medium through which operations are conducted. factors include the ground, weather, climate and infrastructure. Secondly, we need to understand the relevance of the physical geography to the audience. Different people perceive and use the physical environment in significantly different ways. for example, a particular building may hold cultural significance to a key audience, and so should not be considered solely for its physical utility.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The context comprises the historical, political, economic, cultural and social background to the situation or conflict. It shapes what resources and missions are allocated to land forces, their freedoms, constraints and relationships with other actors. It also shapes, but cannot predict, the likely consequences of our actions, which in turn contribute to the evolving context. Actions will have both intended and unintended effects. These can be positive or negative, immediate, short or long term, and will be perceived and interpreted differently by different parts of the audience. Commanders, therefore, need to constantly assess and re-assess the consequences of their actions, as perceived by the audience, and adjust accordingly.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding is a means to an end; nothing happens until action is taken. What is important is to draw from the available relevant information what effects and combinations of actions are required, and then to act appropriately and quickly, relative to other actors. furthermore, it is through action that understanding is often best developed. Only so much can be learned through observation and study; early actions should usually be seen as a bridge from preliminary understanding to Integrated Action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated Action blends lethal and non-lethal actions to have effects on the understanding, physical capability, will and cohesion of the audience. Organised into attainable objectives, these effects are ultimately realised in people’s minds, influencing their decision making, to achieve the desired outcomes. Although not all tactical activities are directed against people, the ultimate targets of land power are the audience and actors (including enemies, adversaries, allies and civilians). Integrated Action is planned from desired outcome back to actions, through objectives and effects, and adjusted in execution in response to what has been learned and the changing situation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Informed by continuous analysis of the audience, the commander describes the desired outcomes, an outcome being a favourable and enduring situation. Where appropriate to the tasks assigned and the resources available, outcomes are described in terms of changed or maintained understanding and behaviour. In all cases, however, land forces operate in a context where the success of military actions is judged by a wide audience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Because military operations are unpredictable, they must be designed to allow those executing the plan to focus on clearly defined and attainable tactical objectives, in the context of desired and potential outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Objectives are achieved by effects that bring about changes (or not) in a particular object, for example maintaining the support of particular actors or denying an enemy access to a piece of terrain. Integrated Action, seeks effects on the understanding, physical capability, and will and cohesion of actors, consistent with the desired outcome.
a. The decision-making of actors is, like ours, grounded on their understanding, how they perceive and interpret particular situations. Actions can affect their understanding directly or indirectly. Often, how key individuals understand a situation can affect the decisions and behaviour of larger groups. for example, enemy commanders who have been deceived, or denied the ability to make accurate assessments, will give less effective direction to their subordinates; a force might show additional resolve as a result of the actions of just one individual; or a community might leave a town or stay in it, support an enemy or not, depending on how a few influential people interpret the situation.
b. Our actions can damage, build or maintain physical capability in the form of people, equipment and infrastructure and the means to sustain or direct them. for example, an enemy’s physical capability can be destroyed or denied; partner forces can be equipped and trained; and communities can be provided with or given improved access to resources and infrastructure.
c. Our actions can seek to affect actors’ will and cohesion positively or negatively, depending on the desired outcome. Land forces can use Integrated Action to bolster or maintain partner and community will and cohesion, for example, by using capacity building or fire support to improve partner forces’ morale.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Having identified the effects required, a commander integrates the actions and capabilities available to achieve them. Those actions taken by the land force are normally worded as tasks, which, together with their purpose, constitute subordinates’ missions. At the tactical level, such missions are typically fixed: they require specific activity, such as attacking, seizing terrain, building a bridge or providing logistic support. A capacity to think laterally beyond these missions is, however, required; commanders must always consider the wider impact of their actions and how they might contribute to first and second order effects and outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The tactical functions are the primary levers of influence, representing the full breadth of the force’s activities that are integrated when orchestrating and executing operations. These are, however, rarely sufficient. Commanders and staff must also seek to integrate a range of different levers not under their direct control; they must, therefore, cooperate with joint, inter-governmental, inter-agency, non- governmental, private sector and multinational actors involved in the operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Those tactical functions mainly directed towards actors are: manoeuvre, fires, information activities and capacity building. Their successful application depends on command and intelligence which set the operation’s direction, and protection and sustainment which enable the mission. These tactical functions can also have direct and indirect effects on the audience as well as on the mission itself. for example, how a force collects intelligence, protects or sustains itself may directly affect the audience’s perceptions of the force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The nature of the task determines how the tactical functions are applied. When fighting, for example, the main effects sought are on the will of the enemy and so this aspect of Integrated Action is guided at the tactical level by the Manoeuvrist Approach. As each operation is unique, however, there is no single way by which actions are integrated. Rather, there are doctrinal frameworks, common to varying degrees in joint and NATO doctrine, which aid the organisation and visualisation of Integrated Action. These are the operational and tactical frameworks, which link groups of actions by their purpose, and the geographic framework which does so by their location in relation to the force. The tactical functions and doctrinal frameworks are explained in Chapter 8.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Manoeuvrist Approach is the Army’s fighting doctrine for the tactical level. It determines the way we fight enemies across the different types of operation, and because fighting can have extremely significant consequences, it is set in the broader context of the audience and Integrated Action. It is an indirect approach which emphasises effects on the will of the enemy. It blends lethal and non- lethal actions to achieve objectives which shape the enemy’s understanding, undermine their will and break their cohesion. It aims to apply strength against vulnerabilities. Significant features are momentum, tempo and agility, which in combination lead to shock and surprise. It entails doing the unexpected, using initiative and seeking originality, combined with a relentless determination to succeed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
This section describes the requirements of the Manoeuvrist Approach; ways of seizing and holding the initiative; and how to shape the understanding of enemies, undermine their will and break their cohesion. Although explained separately below, gaining the initiative and attacking vulnerabilities must be seamlessly connected. each reinforces and enables the other.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Manoeuvrist Approach, enabled by Mission Command, has two specific requirements: an attitude of mind and understanding of the enemy’s vulnerabilities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
First, the Manoeuvrist Approach requires an attitude of mind that seeks indirect solutions to reduce the enemy’s will to fight, by pitching our strength against enemy vulnerability, rather than strength. This indirect approach emphasises the use of initiative to act in original ways unexpected by the enemy and a relentless determination to retain the initiative and exploit success. It does not preclude destruction of the enemy so long as the results sought are disproportionately greater than the resources applied and the enemy’s will to fight is undermined and their cohesion shattered. It depends on practical knowledge, agility, Mission Command and the willingness to accept risks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The second requirement is an understanding of the enemy’s vulnerabilities, both before contact and as they appear and evolve during battle. Centre of gravity analysis can be a useful tool for this. The Manoeuvrist Approach guides us to find, attack, and exploit these vulnerabilities in an enemy’s strength. Additionally, commanders must consider carefully how the enemy themselves might apply the Manoeuvrist Approach. They must understand their own centre of gravity and critical vulnerabilities, and protect their forces accordingly. Contextual understanding is also necessary. The Manoeuvrist Approach is not executed in isolation from wider contextual and operational factors, for example, domestic appetite for risk and casualties (of friendly and enemy forces), or second and third order effects of actions taken.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The tools of seizing the initiative, shaping understanding and attacking will and cohesion are means to an end. By holding the initiative and operating at higher tempo than the enemy, we aim to impose multiple, simultaneous dilemmas, forcing the enemy to make decisions favourable to us or, when necessary, to induce shock and so render the enemy incapable of rational decision making. The classic physiological and psychological symptoms of shock are numbness and irrational behaviour, preventing the enemy from responding effectively to a developing situation. It is most debilitating when the full range of the force’s capabilities, lethal and non-lethal, is applied against enemy vulnerabilities. As an effect, shock is both unpredictable and temporary, so its effects must be rapidly exploited before the enemy can respond effectively.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The initiative is the ability to dictate the course of events, to decide and act before our opponents do and so gain advantage. In contact with an enemy, gaining, regaining and retaining the initiative requires: tempo, surprise, pre- emption, momentum, simultaneity, exploitation and avoiding culmination. They cannot be applied in isolation, but are mutually reinforcing.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Tempo is the rate of activity of operations relative to an enemy’s. It is about acting more quickly than the enemy. The side which consistently decides and acts fastest should gain and hold an advantage. Speed and quality of decision-making, while necessary to gain and hold the initiative, is not sufficient. Action must follow swiftly, enabled by Mission Command and good battle procedure. Often a perfect plan made and executed too late will fail, whereas an imperfect one made before an enemy can act will succeed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Surprise is an important way of seizing and retaining the initiative. It must be central to the design of all combat operations and be sought by commanders at all levels.
a. Surprise is a potent psychological weapon, causing shock through unexpected action in time, space and method. for example, surprise can be achieved by: attacking an enemy earlier or more rapidly than anticipated, including through cyber electromagnetic activities (time); attacking the enemy’s rear, or preparing well concealed depth defences (space); unforeseen employment of air manoeuvre or indigenous forces, the concealment and employment of reserves or sudden withdrawal to defensive positions (method).
b. The increasing visibility of a land force’s actions places increased importance on the use of deception to achieve surprise and to protect the force’s own vulnerabilities. Deception is defined as those measures designed to mislead the enemy by manipulation, distortion, or falsification of evidence to induce them to react in a manner prejudicial to their interests. There are two methods of deception: simulation, which deliberately allows an enemy to see false activity (for example through a demonstration); and dissimulation, which is hiding the reality by concealing it or making it appear to be something else. Deception plans must have a clearly defined aim, be convincing by playing to enemy’s perceptions, prejudices and likely reactions, and be flexible, without consuming disproportionate resources or time. enemies will also employ deception, requiring commanders and staff to have a sceptical mind-set.
c. The acme of surprise is when it combines high tempo physical manoeuvre, superiority in the virtual domain, and concentrated application of violence – sometimes termed ‘shock action’. enabled by security, surprise involves using combinations of secrecy, concealment, deception, originality, audacity and tempo to confuse, paralyse or disrupt effective decision-making, and undermine an adversary’s morale. Thus it is instrumental not only to gaining the initiative, but also subsequently to attacking and defeating the enemy. It need not be total, but merely sufficient to instil doubt, delaying a decision or an action until it is too late. The effects of surprise are transitory, as shock and confusion recede over time, so its effects should be exploited rapidly and aggressively.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Pre-emption is to seize an opportunity, which may itself be fleeting, to deny the enemy an advantage before they act. It denies them the initiative and frustrates their plan. Its success lies in the speed with which the situation can be subsequently exploited.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Momentum is the driving force of a moving object. Maintaining momentum keeps an enemy off-balance and enables a commander to retain the initiative. As a product of velocity and mass, it is liable to be reduced through either a loss of speed or of combat power, stalling the operation and so allowing the enemy to regain the initiative. exploitation of momentum creates the bridge from seizing the initiative to achieving success.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Simultaneity seeks to disrupt the decision-making process of opponents by confronting them with a number of concurrent problems. By attacking or threatening enemies in many ways and from many directions at once, in the physical and virtual domains, they cannot concentrate on any one attack, nor establish priorities between them. They cannot choose how and where to react; they are torn between multiple threats and find it hard to respond coherently. enemy cohesion is particularly susceptible when several layers of their command system are acted against simultaneously.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Exploitation is defined as taking full advantage of success in battle and following up initial gains. If not exploited, the effects of surprise and shock, pre-emption, tempo, momentum and simultaneity are likely to be local and temporary. A capable enemy will try to recover and seek ways of regaining the initiative. Therefore success should be exploited to maintain the initiative, extend and expand its effects and encourage collapse. exploitation can be planned or opportunistic. Planned exploitation is designed in advance to follow anticipated success and may require fresh, echeloned forces. Opportunistic exploitation is a way of building on local success. It should be carried out with the resources at hand and should be initiated as soon as an opportunity is recognised, particularly at lower tactical levels. The most effective exploitation integrates the full range of lethal and non-lethal capabilities available to the force, appropriate according to the task and environment. for example, a combat action may be exploited by manoeuvre and information activities or, in a counter-insurgency context, by a combination of information activities and capacity building. exploitation is enabled by Mission Command, effective understanding and balanced, mobile and flexible reserve or echeloned forces, which can be deployed rapidly to take advantage of the opportunities presented.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Avoiding culmination is also key and must be constantly balanced with the advantages presented by exploitation. The culminating point is defined as the point in time and the location at which a force no longer has the capability to continue an operation under current conditions and so loses the initiative. An operational pause may be required: a temporary and deliberate cessation of certain activities during the course of an operation to avoid reaching the culminating point and to be able to regenerate the combat power required to proceed with the next stage of the operation. Anticipation of when or where a force might reach a culminating point requires detailed understanding of the environment as well as of friendly and enemy forces. Implementation of an operational pause at a place and time to the advantage of friendly forces allows the initiative to be maintained.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Manoeuvrist Approach seeks to manipulate an enemy’s understanding to produce behavioural outcomes favourable to the friendly force. The perception of failure is the best mechanism by which to promote actual failure, convincing the enemy of the futility of their actions. The shock induced by surprise and an enemy’s loss of initiative all contribute to this perception of failure. Security, deception and information activities amplify their effects and are therefore central to the Manoeuvrist Approach. They are not, however, sufficient. Shaping the enemy’s understanding conclusively is rarely achievable without the application or threat of force, attacking will and cohesion.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The will and cohesion of a force are indivisible. Will is the determination to persist in the face of adversity. It has two aspects: intent and resolve. Both can be influenced, attacked and undermined. The enemy’s intent is thwarted when they believe that their aim is no longer achievable, and so desist from their course of action. The enemy’s resolve is their strength of will. It is overcome when they are demoralised and no longer have the desire to continue. It is intimately linked to the cohesion of the force. The same principle applies to our own force; we must protect our own will and cohesion from the actions of enemies and adversaries.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Troops who have moral cohesion stick together: they continue to fight despite adversity and local reverses. It relies on leadership, perception of success, confidence and trust that forces will be supported and sustained. It cannot, therefore, be separated from the physical cohesion that gives a force its potential to mass forces and effects at the time and place of its choosing. Physical cohesion relies on sustainment, freedom of movement, and effective command systems of leaders, command posts and communications.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Physical capability is also a feature of cohesion. If key combat forces, combat service support or command nodes are lost or threatened, then both moral and physical cohesion of the enemy are reduced, while the freedom of action and initiative of friendly forces are enhanced. Attacking and often destroying physical capabilities is therefore required by the Manoeuvrist Approach as a means to an end of defeating the enemy’s will to fight.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Ultimately, without moral and physical cohesion, a force becomes less than the sum of its parts and readily susceptible to shock. As well as using surprise and pre-emption, cohesion and will can be attacked through dislocation, disruption and destruction.
a. Dislocation denies the enemy the ability to bring their strengths to bear, or to persuade them that their strength is irrelevant. Its purpose is wider than the frustration of the enemy’s plan; it is about ensuring that their strengths are in the wrong place. It may be deliberate or a fortunate consequence of other actions. Deep penetration, envelopment and deception are three methods of dislocation. Another method is distraction, encouraging the enemy to cover more options than they can afford.
b. Disruption can be used to break apart and confuse assets that are critical to the employment and coherence of the enemy’s fighting power. It aims to rupture the integrity of a force, to render it incapable of deciding and acting purposefully. Military targets might include communication networks, command centres, transport nodes, or logistic facilities. Against irregular forces, disruption can be achieved by attacking vulnerabilities in the enemy’s networks.
c. Destruction, when unsupported or unfocused, is not normally a major contributor to shock, other than when used on a massive scale. Otherwise, the careful selection and destruction of discrete capabilities or force elements amplifies the effects of surprise, dislocation and disruption, and can be decisive in undermining an enemy’s will to fight. Such targeted destruction may well be the focus of all of the forces of a particular formation or battlegroup within a wider concept of operations. The effects of destruction also extend beyond the elimination of a particular capability and demoralisation of the wider force. Second order consequences may include adverse or positive reactions from across the audience, or a later requirement to reinstate the same capability for use by friendly forces or the local population.

Command is the authority vested in an individual of the armed forces for the direction, coordination, and control of military forces. The manner in which command is exercised by armed forces is described as their command philosophy. The British Army’s command philosophy is Mission Command. This philosophy is founded on the clear expression of intent by commanders, and the freedom of subordinates to act to achieve that intent. Mission Command is common across Defence and is the allied concept for command and control of NATO land forces. As a command philosophy, it comprises commonly understood principles and guidelines for application; its expression will, however, vary in relation to cultural, task and operational factors. This chapter places Mission Command in context, explaining the nature of command. It then describes Mission Command, its principles and how it is applied in practice.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Historically, land forces have employed different command philosophies, ranging from Mission Command to more centralised control. Centralised control seeks to impose order and certainty on the battlefield. It does not, however, account for the adversarial and dynamic nature of conflict, where success comes from the speed of appropriate reaction to a changing situation, and from the initiative and will to fight of every soldier and unit. Higher commanders responsible for planning and executing operations cannot feasibly make timely and appropriate lower level tactical decisions; these are best made quickly by subordinate commanders on the spot.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In conflict, even the most robust communication systems are not completely reliable. This failure occurs through either the friction inherent in conflict or an adversary’s cyber or electromagnetic attack. In such circumstances, subordinates require freedom of action, within the constraints of their commanders’ intent, to prevail over friction and chaos. Success demands a command philosophy which draws strength from but is not reliant on improving communications, enables the rapid identification and exploitation of opportunity to match strength against vulnerability, and harnesses the disciplined initiative of all forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
For UK Armed forces, command authority has a legal and constitutional status, codified for the British Army in Queen’s Regulations, and is vested in commanders by a higher authority that gives direction and assigns forces for them to accomplish missions. The exercise of command is the process by which commanders make decisions, impress their will on and transmit their intentions to subordinates. With authority comes responsibility and accountability – all three of which must be correctly aligned for command to be effective. This is particularly important when responsibility is delegated, as it usually is. Authority is the power and right to give orders and enforce obedience. responsibility is the ability and obligation to act independently and make decisions. Accountability is the requirement and expectation to justify actions and decisions.
a. Authority may come with a specific appointment, by virtue of rank, or be delegated by an appropriately authorised superior. When a commander delegates authority, the scope of that authority is stated in orders, including the command relationships of subordinate force elements. When a commander delegates responsibility, it must be matched with the required delegated authority. Too little authority and the subordinate will not be able to assume full responsibility. Too much and a subordinate may misjudge and over-reach. It is essential that subordinate commanders and staff officers do not exceed their authority.
b. With the authority granted to commanders comes a wide range of standing responsibilities, dependent on their position, rank or delegations. In addition to these, military operations in general and Mission Command in particular rely on subordinates receiving additional responsibility for missions and tasks so that they can achieve their commander’s intent. It is essential that the responsibility assigned over the forces and resources matches the mission or task, and that the requisite authority accompanies it. Otherwise, the subordinate will not have the required materials and power to succeed. Responsibility also involves an obligation to complete the task to the best of a commander’s ability.
c. Accountability ensures that authority is exercised appropriately and that responsibilities are fulfilled. Whoever has authority and responsibility for anything will, if necessary, be required to justify their actions, and will be responsible in law for their decisions and actions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
By delegation, commanders use their authority to ensure that along with resources, subordinates receive the appropriate authority and responsibility for their missions and tasks. Whoever has authority delegated to them becomes accountable for the mission and the conduct of the forces under their command. Delegation does not detract from the authority of superior commanders (delegation can be rescinded), and since they are responsible for the decision to delegate and for the actions of subordinates, the superior commanders retain overall accountability. So, commanders and subordinates to whom they delegate share authority, responsibility and accountability for delegated missions and for the forces under their command.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military command at all levels is the art of decision making, motivating and directing forces into action to accomplish missions. It is founded on understanding and constant assessment of the operating environment and its various actors and audiences, people, resources, risk and desired outcomes. A commander determines courses of action to be taken, leads the force and controls the execution of the mission. The three functions of command, which are inter-dependent, are decision-making, leadership and control (see figure 6-1). A command system comprises not only the commander, but also the staff who, depending on the level of command, contribute to the effect of all three functions, with particular emphasis on control. Deficiencies in any of the constituents of command have a detrimental effect on a force’s fighting power as a whole.
a. Timely, accurate and effective decision-making (including assessing risk) increases tempo relative to opponents, thereby increasing the probability of success on operations. Decision-making stems from a blend of structured military processes and intuition, developed through experience, education and training. Intuition and judgement are key when making difficult decisions, evaluating risk and exploiting fleeting opportunities on the basis of incomplete information. Knowing when to be resolute and when to consider a change in direction are fundamental skills of a commander and are features of strong leadership. Making major decisions is a commander’s responsibility, including judgements relating to the whole force, especially those relating to less quantifiable aspects of the art of war, for example when to decide and when to act. The staff also make certain decisions on behalf of the commander, appropriate to their delegated authority, as well as assist the commander’s decision-making.
b. The way in which commanders exercise leadership of their staff and subordinates necessarily impacts on the conduct of the force. Commanders must be strong leaders, capable of adapting their leadership style to the requirements of the operation and force. Different circumstances demand varying degrees of regulation, delegation, inspiration and coercion. Army Leadership Doctrine explores in detail this critical constituent of command.
c. As a function of command, control is the oversight, direction, and coordination of assigned forces in accordance with the commander’s plan and intent. Control is achieved through employing common command doctrine, including standardised procedures for the control of operations and forces. Above sub-unit level, it may be delegated to staff, but at all levels commanders may need to control activity personally to ensure that their intent is achieved.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mission Command is the British Army’s command philosophy. This is an approach which empowers subordinate commanders and promotes initiative as well as freedom and speed of action. Critically, it focuses on achievement of higher intent through mission type orders. It empowers leaders at every level and is intended to generate agility and tempo. This enables us to overcome an enemy in the most chaotic and demanding circumstances and unlocks everyone’s potential to seize winning opportunities, however fleeting. Supporting Integrated Action, Mission Command focuses on outcomes, objectives and effects, rather than specifying the detailed ways in which these are to be achieved. Mission Command depends on: the duty of commanders to express their intent clearly and to ensure that it is understood; the duty of subordinates to act to achieve that intent; and the presumption by subordinates of delegated freedom of action to achieve the intent, within specified and implied constraints.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
For Mission Command to work, the three functions of command must be in harmony. Commanders must ensure that subordinates understand the context and their commander’s intent. Commanders at all levels must use good judgement and initiative to achieve intent and develop a mind-set focused on identifying indirect solutions to problems. Mission Command requires commanders who will make sound decisions without recourse to their higher headquarters and who are comfortable with freedom of action rather than tight control. It also depends on effective leadership at all levels of the force, with the most junior commanders and private soldiers confident and willing to use their initiative and tactical understanding to exploit opportunities. It also requires control: actions must be deconflicted, and resources shared, and some subordinates will need more control than others. If Mission Command is to be instinctive, it must be well understood and practised, not only on all operations and during field training, but every day. Commanders must empower their subordinates routinely because this gives them the confidence to act boldly and independently on the battlefield.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In practice, there are circumstances when commanders must apply greater control of their subordinates. factors to be considered include: the nature of the task, including how complex or time critical it is; and the aptitude and capability of subordinates and staff to apply Mission Command in a given context. In these circumstances it is a superior commander’s duty to ensure that their intent and detailed guidance is understood and followed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In a multinational and inter-agency environment, even when Mission Command is formally advocated, it may be subject to differing national, organisational and individual interpretations and applications. This can be extremely challenging. Improved interoperability may assist to some degree. Commanders and staff must be prepared to adapt, recognising also the requirements of potential partner nations and agencies that will not recognise or be able to practise Mission Command.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mission Command comprises one guiding principle and five further principles. The fundamental guiding principle of Mission Command is the absolute responsibility to act to achieve the superior commander’s intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mission Command requires unity of effort. This stems from the commanders ability to formulate a clear intent and mission statements; the use of common doctrine and tactics; a common language of command; a high standard of collective training; and the designation of priorities and a main effort. Taken together, these provide a framework of common understanding throughout a force. They also assist the coordination of actions in time and space and the ability to anticipate and respond swiftly to changes in the situation.
a. Unity of effort is further enhanced by: commanders’ nesting their plans in the context and intent of superiors, at least two levels up; and ensuring that their own direction is resourced two levels down. This is described as vertical integration. The concept of horizontal integration, which helps subordinates understand how their missions interact with others at their own level, is equally important. Horizontal and vertical integration are essential to delivering cooperation between units and formations within the framework of the commander’s intent.
b. In support of unity of effort, commanders should state a main effort – the activity which the commander considers critical to the success of the mission. However, in the orchestration of complex operations stating a single priority may not always be possible. A main effort is given substance in three ways. firstly, it attracts resources and sufficient fighting power. Secondly, it has relevance for all subordinates, even those who are not part of it; they may lose resources to it, and are expected to support it without further direction should circumstances require it. Thirdly, these main and supporting efforts are integrated into a concept of operations. This might require narrowing boundaries to concentrate force, requiring economy of effort elsewhere.
c. Although there may be a sequence of main efforts, there cannot be more than one at any one time. The main effort should be expressed as a single action together with the principal force undertaking it. Commanders may choose to shift the main effort in response to changing situations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In Mission Command, subordinates must exercise freedom of action, within specified and implied constraints, to act as they see fit to ensure the achievement of the higher commander’s intent.
a. To do so through the inherent friction and chaos of conflict requires subordinates to have the determination, drive, vigour and disciplined initiative to take the plan through to a successful conclusion. Subordinates have the most up-to-date information about the situation in front of them and must make decisions and act quickly without waiting for further orders. When the situation changes, subordinates must rapidly adapt their plans or what they are doing to achieve the intent, using their best judgement and without asking for permission. To nurture boldness and promote a will to win across the force, superior commanders should always support the subordinate’s decision, only overruling it if it is unsuitable. This enables the force to sense opportunities, tackle threats quickly, and generate and maintain tempo.
b. Decentralisation of execution is the means by which freedom of action is achieved. for it to work, commanders provide guidance and constraints that allow subordinates to use their initiative. Commanders must also allocate sufficient resources, including time, information and intelligence, manpower, equipment, materiel, rules of engagement, and space. Critically, decentralisation requires delegation of authority for decision- making within particular constraints. These freedoms and constraints may be clearly stated or implied in orders. The extent of delegation will depend on the superior commander’s judgement of their subordinates. A commander must understand which subordinates will thrive and excel with fewer constraints, and which will require more direction and control. This is likely to inform the kind of tasks different subordinates receive.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Trust is a pre-requisite of command at all levels. Trust improves speed of decision making, and, therefore, tempo. While trust must be earned and not demanded, the default should be for commanders to trust their superiors and subordinates. In particular, they must trust that their subordinates will sensibly interpret their intent and persevere to achieve it. Personal trust can only be built up over time with experience, rather than by reputation. The spirit of Mission Command requires a bond of trust between superiors, subordinates and peers that will develop through shared experience. These bonds are strengthened when commanders tolerate mistakes and foster a climate where failure is an opportunity to learn. This is not about encouraging recklessness or gambling, but about accepting errors in the pursuit of calculated risk-taking, boldness and initiative. If a subordinate cannot trust their superior to support them in such circumstances, the bond of trust will be eroded; the subordinate will not act on their own initiative; and the moral fabric of Mission Command will be lost. Trust is based on a number of qualities, including personal example, integrity, professional competence and attention to detail. The basis of trust is respect and mutual understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Like trust, mutual understanding is established over time and through the application of common doctrine and concepts. With experience, commanders gain understanding of the issues and concerns facing their subordinates, partners and peers. Professional knowledge and study, and the cultivation of personal relationships give subordinates, in turn, an insight into command at higher levels, enabling them to anticipate and apply their initiative to good effect. Mutual understanding is also based on common doctrine and command philosophy and so cannot be assumed when operating in a multinational and inter-agency context. Where shared experience and common doctrine do not exist, commanders should pay particular attention to developing and sustaining mutual understanding as a central pillar of effective interoperability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Successful command requires timely and effective decision-making at all levels. Timely decisions allow our forces to act more quickly than adversaries and enemies can cope with. Despite the increasing availability and speed of information, it remains essential for commanders to make decisions on the basis of incomplete and imperfect understanding. This can seem risky, and good judgement is required to decide when is the right time to act or not act. In general, however, it is often less risky to act quickly than it is to wait for more information and give adversaries more time. Developing an intuitive understanding of when to decide is as integral a component of the art of command as knowing from where to command.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Founded on the principles above and the absolute responsibility to act to achieve the superior commander’s intent, there are practical, sequential actions that guide the effective application of Mission Command.
a. Commanders ensure that their subordinates understand the intent, their own contributions and the context within which they are to act.
b. Commanders exercise minimum control over their subordinates, consistent with the context and nature of mission, and the subordinates’ experience and ability, while retaining responsibility for their actions.
c. Subordinates are told what outcome they are contributing to, the effect they are to realise and why.
d. Subordinates are allocated sufficient resources to carry out their missions.
e. Subordinates decide for themselves how best to achieve their superior’s intent.

Part 3 describes how land forces conduct operations, adhering to the fundamentals of land doctrine and in the context of contemporary conflict. Before land operations begin, land forces must organise appropriately and develop sufficient interoperability with other participating actors. This is the subject of Chapter 7. Chapter 8 then introduces how land forces orchestrate and execute Integrated Action. Chapters 9 and 10 focus on two specific areas critical to all operations – command and sustainment. The AfM series expands on the concepts and themes introduced in Part 3.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
This chapter explains interoperability, how land forces organise for operations, and how they support and are supported by other components. The aim is to provide the baseline knowledge necessary for interoperability within a land force, and between it and other components within a joint force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated Action requires significant cooperation between all elements of the combined arms, joint, inter agency and multinational force. The key enabler for military cooperation is interoperability – the ability to act together coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve tactical, operational and strategic objectives. The purpose of professional study and working and training together with other forces and nations is to build interoperability. Interoperability strengthens and amplifies the unique contributions of all forces and agencies, at every level. Multinational and inter-component interoperability is usually more challenging and needs more effort and resources than interoperability within UK land forces, but even this requires conscious effort. The exact requirement for interoperability is determined according to operational need.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land operations are conducted by combined arms forces because no single arm of the land force can operate entirely independently of other arms. So even within land forces, a high degree of interoperability is required: each arm must be interoperable with every other arm. The start point for interoperability for force elements at all levels, therefore, is competence and the ability to advise with authority on their particular capabilities and limitations. So, when establishing interoperability with other components and contributing to joint campaigns, land forces, by virtue of their professional credibility, knowledge, skills and expertise, are the authority for the planning and execution of land operations. A force element, formation or component seeking to be interoperable with other arms, components or agencies from any nation, must also seek to understand its partners and establish strong working relationships with them. Above this, individuals in the land force must understand the theory and process of interoperability. The requirement for interoperability is defined by the answers to three questions: with whom, to what level and in what functions will force elements organise for operations?
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The level of interoperability required for each relationship varies. In some cases an awareness of a particular activity and suitable de-confliction may suffice. Defence policy defines three levels of interoperability. integrated means that forces are able to merge seamlessly and are interchangeable. Compatible means that forces can interact with each other in the same geographical battlespace in pursuit of a common goal. De-conflicted means that forces can co-exist but not interact with each other. Additionally, in certain cases, the actions or capabilities of a force or agency may even have a damaging impact on those of others, making even co-existence challenging. The level of interoperability within a multinational force is seldom uniform. for example, a multinational corps or division might consist of compatible force elements from contributing nations with some multinational integrated elements (such as the headquarters, some combat support and combat service support force elements). In other circumstances, such as a combined arms battlegroup, full integration lies at the heart of mission success.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
High levels of interoperability take time and resources to develop and maintain, and must be honed through training and by learning lessons during operations. Challenges to achieving interoperability arise from differing cultures, structures, equipment, laws and languages, and critical variations in doctrine, tactics, techniques, procedures and sustainment. These are commonly categorised into three dimensions of interoperability, as illustrated in figure 1.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Technical interoperability concerns systems and equipment. This involves issues such as communication and information systems, connectivity, standardisation of ammunition and other combat supplies. NATO standards are often used to enable technical interoperability. Where possible, procedural interoperability is based on NATO doctrine, procedures and terminology. human interoperability, which includes language, creates trust and mutual understanding by strengthening relationships on operations and in training. It can mitigate shortfalls in the other dimensions of interoperability and so is the responsibility of all members of land forces to nurture and promote. A human interoperability approach is particularly important for defence engagement and capacity building tasks. It has five aspects.
a. Language proficiency is central to multinational interoperability, assisting comprehension and relationship building. even when working in english, it is essential that native speakers communicate clearly, avoiding slang, idioms and ‘quasi-doctrinal’ terms; even formally agreed doctrinal terms may be interpreted differently across a multinational force.
b. effective personal rapport between commanders influences cooperation at all levels. Commanders must strive to develop genuine and robust relationships with each other.
c. Mutual respect for the professional ability, culture, history, religion, customs and values of participants strengthens relationships. Cultural understanding is particularly important to maintaining and promoting the cohesion of a multinational force, and when working with a host nation partner, particularly during capacity building tasks.
d. Time taken to improve knowledge of the doctrine, capabilities and aspirations of partners will pay dividends. It is important that forces and agencies assume a role commensurate with their aspirations, tempered by their capabilities.
e. Patience is essential as differences of opinion, perspective and understanding, whilst natural, may generate friction. A patient approach built on mutual trust and respect, and combined with effective cooperation takes time, but will ultimately bear fruit.

<|startoftext|>
Land forces are generally structured hierarchically into formations, units and sub- units and categorised by function, type and specialist capabilities. They are organised operationally by combining arms to form a cohesive and versatile whole. The principle of combining arms demands high levels of technical, procedural and human interoperability between all arms. This overview explains how land forces organise within combined arms formations – the basis for land environment interoperability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A typical hierarchy flows down from army group to army, corps, division, brigade, unit and sub-unit. formations and units are designed to be modular and scalable, so that elements can be easily added or taken away, and they can be expanded or contracted. The greatest capacity for this lies in corps and divisions.
a. A corps commands a number of divisions, functional brigades and task forces, comprising all types of force element. It is the link between the operational and tactical levels of conflict. It can command at the operational level (as a JTf (Land), or land component headquarters, for example), but in major coalition or alliance operations, it may be a subordinate tactical formation in the land component, operating at the higher tactical level. In the British Army, the corps is the highest level of deployable headquarters and is assigned to NATO as the Allied Rapid Reaction Corps. A corps is fully resourced and structured to orchestrate Integrated Action in a joint, inter-agency and multinational context and can plan and execute large-scale complex operations simultaneously.
b. The division is a tactical formation that commands brigades within a corps, JTf (Land) or theatre framework. A divisional headquarters may form a land component headquarters for specific operations. It is the lowest level formation that routinely commands all types of force element. A division has integral intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR), combat support and combat service support force elements, enabling it to conduct continuous operations. It usually also has at least one manoeuvre brigade. A divisional headquarters, capable of planning and executing simultaneously, can also command at the operational level as a land component headquarters. for example, a combat operation of just one brigade or a capacity building operation made up of several smaller groupings is likely to require command by a divisional headquarters. The division is the lowest level capable of orchestrating Integrated Action and routinely interacting with joint, inter-agency and multinational actors.
c. The brigade is a tactical formation with combat, combat support and combat service support force elements. Its primary focus is on achieving tactical effects. It is at the brigade level that task organisation between combat units takes place to create combined arms battlegroups. A brigade’s capacity to plan and execute operations simultaneously is contingent on the intensity and type of operation.
d. A unit is the smallest grouping capable of independent operations with organic capability over long periods. It contains integral combat service support and limited combat support elements, and is normally commanded by a lieutenant colonel. Units typically have between 400 and 1000 people, the majority of which are of one arm or Service. Units of the British Army are called regiments or battalions. A Royal Marine unit is called a commando. In more demanding types of operation including combat, a unit battlegroup does not normally have the capacity to plan and execute battlegroup level operations simultaneously; it generally does one or the other.
e. A unit contains a number of sub-units, usually three to five. Sub-units are normally commanded by majors, and typically have between 60 and 150 personnel. British sub-units are called squadrons, companies or batteries. Sub-units are usually grouped into battlegroups or task forces but are, for limited periods, capable of independent operations, if they have been provided with suitable combat support and combat service support elements.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces are categorised functionally as either combat, combat support or combat service support force elements.
a. Combat force elements are those that engage the enemy directly. They manoeuvre and fight, typically employing direct fire weapons, to gain ground, find and defeat the enemy, or acquire information. They include armoured, reconnaissance, infantry, and attack and reconnaissance aviation units.
b. Combat support force elements provide operational assistance, including fire and manoeuvre support to Combat force elements. They include support helicopters, artillery, combat engineers, intelligence, communications, command support and information activity specialists.
c. Combat service support is the organisational support provided to the whole force, primarily in the fields of administration and logistics. It includes logistic, health service and equipment support, personnel, welfare and administration force elements. Certain combat service support functions are also provided by combat engineers, such as providing water and electrical power supply, infrastructure and supply routes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Complementary to functional categorisation, land forces are also distinguished by their force type, commonly described in NATO as heavy, medium or light. Combined arms groupings generally comprise more than one force type, but with one being predominant. These force types are brought together (task organised) for specific roles or tasks. for example, in the British Army, armoured infantry brigades are built around heavy force types of tanks, armoured infantry, self- propelled artillery and armoured engineers. In creating a force of a particular type, force design has to make trade-offs between protection, firepower, operational and tactical mobility, and logistic demand. All forces are strategically mobile. They can go by sea or in the case of light forces, by air, to anywhere in the world.
a. The forces with the most firepower and protection tend to be equipped with heavy armoured vehicles. To maximise firepower and protection, a compromise is made with operational and tactical mobility. Their operational mobility is limited by high logistic demand. But their tactical mobility is excellent, except in the most densely complex terrain, particularly when enabled by armoured combat engineers. On the other hand, dismounted light forces have limited firepower and intrinsic protection. Yet they can theoretically go anywhere that human beings can go – into mountains, forests, marshes, buildings, caves or subterranean structures. But their operational mobility, without assistance, is limited to how far and fast a soldier can march. Of course, when light forces are supported, by aircraft or vehicles, they can go anywhere within a theatre very quickly.
b. The operational mobility of a force can be enhanced by trading off firepower and protection. The force can be equipped with armoured vehicles that are optimised for long range manoeuvre, but still have some valuable protection and firepower. This reduces the range of threats that they can deal with, but can give advantages, particularly if access to the theatre by sea or air is challenged or denied. Also, this level of mobility can enable rapid concentration and dispersion of a force, enhancing the scope for security and surprise.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A further categorisation is of particular specialist capabilities, which include: ISR, air manoeuvre, amphibious and capacity building forces Several NATO countries also have specialist mountain forces.
a. The primary purpose of ISR forces is to collect, process and disseminate the information and intelligence required to enable understanding of the human, information and physical aspects of the land environment. They can be close, medium or long range and can support all force types. Task organised into combined arms groupings, their composition depends on the level at which they operate and their task; they also often include forces from outside the land component (for example special forces or human intelligence specialists). At the higher tactical level, ISR tasks may be allocated to a combined arms battlegroup or formation. Although reconnaissance and surveillance tasks differ in scope and duration, when resourced and prepared appropriately, ISR forces are generally capable of conducting both tasks. These forces include, but are not limited to: manned and unmanned air systems including aviation reconnaissance; certain combat, combat support (including intelligence specialists) and combat service support force elements; and technical ISR assets exploiting cyber electromagnetic activities of all actors in the area of operations. Although ISR forces generally avoid armed contact, reconnaissance forces, when supported by fires, can provide guards and screens, or be used to degrade enemy ISR capabilities.
b. Air manoeuvre forces are a specialist type of light force. They exploit the mobility of aircraft to provide reach and speed. Air manoeuvre forces include attack, support and reconnaissance helicopters, air assault and airborne infantry with organic combat support and combat service support. Their actions are closely integrated with all forms of air power and the actions of ground manoeuvre forces if also deployed. Air manoeuvre forces are also intrinsic to amphibious manoeuvre, used to project force onto objectives beyond a specific beach or landing site. Once on the ground, air manoeuvre forces have the strengths and weaknesses of light forces.
c. An amphibious force consists of a naval force and a landing force, together with supporting forces that are trained, organised and equipped for amphibious operations. Amphibious forces undertake littoral or riverine operations, deployed and supported (at least initially) from ships. Amphibious forces conduct landing force operations in the littoral environment, which are land areas predominantly susceptible to engagement and influence from the sea. Landing force operations, conducted in accordance with Joint Action, require close integration of joint forces, routinely comprising: an amphibious task group; landing force; battlefield helicopters and air group; and joint enablers.
d. Capacity building tasks can (and often must) be conducted by any appropriately skilled and prepared force element. UK land forces, however, include specially trained, structured and equipped capacity building forces. These include those designed to develop the capacity of host nation security forces as well as those able to assist with physical and organisational infrastructure development.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The combination of capabilities provided by different force elements and types, when they have sufficiently high levels of interoperability, produces extremely powerful combined arms forces, where the sum of the parts is greater than the whole. This combination of forces is the norm for all formations and units on operations. As a guide, during warfighting operations a combined arms force is designed to be capable of the four complementary and concurrent functions of the tactical framework: find, fix, strike and exploit. It should also always have a reserve. These functions do not require equally sized forces for each; rather they are resourced according to the tactical requirements.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Task organisation is the process by which combined arms forces are formed. Task organisation during operations increases flexibility. It depends, however, on appropriate interoperability, enabled by common doctrine and common or compatible procedures, and developed during training. Commanders must balance the flexibility of frequent task organisation with a potential reduction in tempo.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In the British Army, the term battlegroup has a particular meaning. A battlegroup is a combined arms force commanded by a combat unit headquarters. It comprises sub-units drawn from armoured, reconnaissance, infantry or aviation units. A task force refers to a combined arms force created for a specific purpose. It is based on the headquarters of any type of force, at unit and formation level, and is not limited to a combat arm.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Interoperability is also required between land forces and other components and capabilities. The basis of this form of interoperability is an understanding of their characteristics, and of the relationships, dependencies and mutual support between them and land forces. This is just the start. Interoperability, at whatever level required, can be improved through deeper study and training together.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Air is the most important physical environmental interface for land forces, which also have their own integral air assets (primarily unmanned aircraft and helicopters). Gaining, maintaining and exploiting control of the air is critical to success in most operations in the land environment. Air power is also an accelerant to actions in the land environment: generating intelligence, delivering fires, and significantly enhancing options for manoeuvre at far greater speed and reach than can be achieved on the ground alone. Seizing the potential of the air environment is not discretionary for land forces. They must understand the attributes of airpower, the fundamentals of air-land integration, and how the separate air and land components can complement their strengths and mitigate their weaknesses. Land operations are conceived, planned and executed as air-land operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The core attributes of air power, whether drawn from air, maritime or land components, are the exploitation of height, speed and reach. Height allows manoeuvre in three dimensions; speed projects power rapidly and responsively; and reach opens up adversaries’ vulnerabilities otherwise protected.
a. These core attributes enable and enhance additional characteristics. Air power’s reach combined with increasing persistence gives it ubiquity; it can pose or counter threats simultaneously across a wide area. Its speed gives it tactical agility and operational flexibility, able to achieve multiple effects over distance and in a short period. for example, aviation can rapidly switch from intelligence gathering to fires in different parts of the battlespace. Speed and reach also mean that effects can be quickly concentrated in time and space, amplified by precision technology.
b. Air power also has inherent constraints. The most significant are its relative impermanence, limited payload and vulnerability. The latter includes the fragility of aircraft, the effects of weather and the requirement for well-found and secure basing, logistic and equipment support.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Air power has four fundamental roles; control of the air; intelligence and situational awareness; attack; and air mobility. These roles provide the basis for understanding air power and also frame how air power, including from the land component, can support land forces.
a. Control of the air is crucial. It enables freedom of manoeuvre in all of the physical environments. Control of the air helps commanders to seize and hold the initiative. Rather than talking of air ‘superiority’, it is more accurate to define control of the air as the freedom, bound by time, to use a volume of airspace, while, if necessary, denying its use to an opponent. Adversaries who possess advanced air forces and some non-state adversaries are able to challenge control. This is particularly the case at lower altitudes which are likely to be contested with portable air defence systems, rockets, rocket-propelled grenades and small arms. Rotary and slow fixed-wing aircraft (including unmanned aircraft), cooperating closely with or as part of the land component, necessarily operate within the envelope of these weapons, so are vulnerable, particularly during take-off and landing.
b. The high vantage point afforded by air and space allows a view of the land battlespace across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, enhancing intelligence and situational awareness. Aircraft and space platforms, including unmanned air systems, provide layers of sensing in depth that, integrated with other sources, allow commanders to search out information on the human and physical aspects of the land environment. Unmanned aircraft, because of their flexibility, endurance and the risks that can be taken, are changing the way the air environment is exploited to find information.
c. Land forces can also be supported by air targeting the enemy and their infrastructure, or by using the psychological effects of air power to attack will, for example by making shows of force. Air attack can be executed to shape the strategic context or to support operations or tactical engagements. Air interdiction seeks to destroy, disrupt, divert or delay enemies’ surface potential before it can be used effectively. Close air support provides land forces with firepower to destroy, suppress, neutralise, disrupt, fix or delay an enemy, often in close proximity to friendly forces. Close air support requires detailed integration with the fire and manoeuvre of land forces for targeting guidance and to avoid fratricide. It can be delivered by a combination of fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. Helicopters can be task organised to a land formation, included within its scheme of manoeuvre or given their own mission and area of operations.
d. Air mobility supports deployment, sustainment and manoeuvre. It includes air drop, air manoeuvre missions, personnel recovery and aeromedical evacuation. Air mobility enables the global, regional and local deployment of personnel and materiel, both military and civilian. It is the fastest way to move supplies and mass forces. Intra- and inter-theatre air mobility is often the only way to get wounded personnel to medical facilities quickly enough to save lives and to conduct an efficient relief of troops.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Air-land integration (ALI) is a particular form of interoperability between the air and land components. It describes the creation and execution of simple operational and tactical plans by land and air forces, synergistically blending land and air power across all activities, from ISR to fires, manoeuvre and sustainment. ALI is a concept that requires strong relationships built over time, effective training and resourcing, an awareness of joint doctrine and capabilities, and detailed co-ordination and liaison between air and land components. To achieve ALI, air staff are fully integrated within core planning teams from the outset; and land formations maintain sufficient numbers of air-minded personnel at tactical and operational levels. Common and assured procedures between air and ground forces are essential, particularly because in multinational operations, the air component is also most likely to be multinational.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Effective interoperability between air and land components is particularly important for the planning and execution of air manoeuvre operations. These provide commanders with an ability to deploy light land forces rapidly, and to support all force types across the battlespace, either as part of land manoeuvre or as a means of projecting land power in its own right. They are initiated and controlled by land forces (with the exception of certain amphibious operations). The air component plays a key role in air manoeuvre. The cooperation between components has an air to air element, as battlefield helicopters are usually part of the land component or amphibious task group. Air manoeuvre takes different forms.
a. Airborne operations involve the movement of combat forces and their logistic support into an objective area by air. forces reach their objective by parachute (referred to as air drop by NATO) or air-land delivery.
b. Air assault operations deliver combat forces by helicopter within direct fire of their objective. In amphibious operations, this is part of ‘ship to objective manoeuvre’.
c. Airmobile operations are those in which combat forces and equipment manoeuvre by aircraft to engage in ground combat. Unlike air assault, airmobile operations do not deliver forces directly onto an objective and so require less specialist training.
d. Independent helicopter tasks are also carried out within a force’s scheme of manoeuvre.

The relationship between land and air components is synergistic, with the land component providing critical support to, and enhancing the effectiveness of, air operations. first, land forces share airspace with air forces, including for the use of their own aircraft and weapon trajectories. Through understanding of ALI and associated control measures, land forces coordinate and arrange ground troops and their activities with regard to the air environment. Second, land forces mitigate the vulnerabilities of air power by defending airfields, supporting essential logistics requirements and suppressing or destroying enemy air defences. Third, land forces can seize and hold terrain from which enemy air assets can be engaged or which might be used as forward operating bases or airfields. finally, land forces can operate to make the enemy more vulnerable to air power.

<|startoftext|>
As an island nation with global interests and responsibilities, UK land forces rely on the maritime component for sustainment, projection and support of land operations. furthermore, as urban-littoral populations grow, land forces will necessarily conduct operations at this interface of land and maritime components’ battlespace, where each component supports the other. for land forces, this requires an understanding of: the attributes of maritime power projection, the littoral environment, and where mutual support can be offered.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The principal attributes of maritime power are: access, mobility, sustained reach, posture, versatility, resilience, leverage and lift capacity. Maritime forces also have the ability to remain poised at sea for extended periods as an act of coercion, with limited political liability, and then take direct action against targets ashore. These attributes can be exploited through the three roles of maritime power: warfighting, maritime security, and international engagement.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Maritime capabilities can create a broad range of effects and influence from the sea into the land environment in support of land forces. These include demonstration of political intent, early theatre entry, enduring littoral operations, long-term sustainment and support to operations, and the application, or the threat of maritime strike. Maritime close air support, other joint fires and air mobility are significant enablers to inland activity, especially in the early stages of an operation, before a land foothold has been established. Maritime platforms contribute intelligence, area surveillance and communications capabilities to land forces. They can provide: air defence over littoral areas; logistic support; clean facilities for deep maintenance and casualty treatment; and locations from which to exercise command. Maritime forces can also protect land forces by providing a sea-based defensive barrier, or by preventing enemy manoeuvre from the sea.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Over two thirds of the world’s population live within 200 kilometres of the sea and most states have a coastline. Operational theatres with coastlines present both opportunities and challenges for land forces. Complex coastlines with navigable inlets, estuaries and offshore islands may see land and maritime forces operating in very close proximity, thus presenting battlespace management challenges. It is in this littoral environment that amphibious operations are conducted.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Amphibious operations are maritime activities, launched from the sea by a naval and landing force embarked in ships or other craft, with the principal purpose of projecting the landing force ashore tactically into an environment ranging from permissive to hostile. Primarily conducted to create effects in the land environment, there are four types of amphibious operation.
a. Amphibious raids involve swift incursion into or temporary occupation of an objective followed by a planned withdrawal. Concentrated in time, space and resources, they seek to destroy or disrupt adversary infrastructure, gain information, create a diversion, capture or evacuate individuals and/or equipment.
b. Amphibious assault is the principal type of amphibious operation, establishing, with some permanence, a force on a hostile or potentially hostile shore. Amphibious assaults exploit the full effect of maritime power for the rapid build-up of landing forces ashore.
c. Amphibious withdrawal concerns the extraction of forces by sea from a hostile or potentially hostile shore in preparation for re-deployment.
d. An amphibious demonstration seeks to deceive an enemy by a show of force with
the expectation of deluding the enemy into an unfavourable course of action. An amphibious demonstration must pose a credible threat to the enemy, requiring them to allocate sufficient forces to counter the apparent threat.
The integral aviation and surface manoeuvre craft, stores capacity and diverse skill sets make amphibious forces well suited to a range of other operations, including non- combatant evacuation operations, humanitarian assistance and disaster relief.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land and maritime forces operate together not only in the littoral, but also in the riverine operating environment. This is an inland, coastal or river delta area comprising both land and water, characterised by limited land lines of communication. Waterways are extensions of the littoral, and so provide an important conduit for the conduct of amphibious actions, offering natural penetration points as well as obstacles. Riverine actions can provide freedom of movement for land operations or deny it to an adversary. Although amphibious forces can be structured and trained for riverine operations, they can also be conducted by other maritime or land component forces. These must be able to exercise command of the riverine operation and also control the riverine environment, including the sub-surface element.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There is potential for tactical synergy between land and maritime components beyond amphibious operations. Land forces can neutralise threats to naval forces from the shore, undermining adversary anti-access and area denial efforts. They can seize and guard onshore infrastructure required by naval forces and also provide landing forces and fires for amphibious operations. for instance, land forces might secure naval infrastructure or suppress coastal defences while maritime forces conduct shaping operations in depth. Having mutually enhanced the joint commander’s freedom of action, land forces might then exploit along a coastline, supporting and supported by maritime forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Special forces provide strategic insight and precision effects in all operating environments. Designed, trained and equipped to operate at the strategic and operational levels, they create effects beyond the reach, capability or expertise of conventional forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The degree of cooperation between land forces and special forces depends on the nature of the operation. Routinely, special forces operate at the strategic level, which may, or may not, require detailed planning and cooperation with the land force and other components.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At the operational level, they usually form a component alongside those of maritime, land, air and logistic forces, either within an integrated JTF headquarters or in supporting/supported relationships with other components. from a UK perspective, command and control of UK Special Forces (UKSf) operations is directed on a case by case basis by the Chief of the Defence Staff. On joint operations, special forces operations will typically be deconflicted in time and space from land forces. even then, there are likely to be interests common with land forces. These include how the audience and key actors respond to military activity, target deconfliction, access to intelligence and communications systems, management of the electromagnetic spectrum, fire support coordination, sustainment and personnel recovery.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
`even though special forces will rarely be deployed for tactical effect, there will be occasions demanding closer cooperation between them and land forces at the tactical level. These include circumstances when land forces’ tactical actions have operational or strategic level consequences, resulting in closer proximity of force elements or the sharing of particular capabilities. for example, on a capacity building mission, land forces may operate alongside special forces. Or, specific counter-terrorism or hostage rescue skills, only held by special forces, may be required within the battlespace of a land force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Effective cooperation with special forces requires an understanding of their characteristics, principles of employment, roles, planning considerations, limitations and dependencies. each nation’s Special forces vary according to national requirements. The term special operations forces (SOF), common in NATO, encompasses a breadth of units with unique capabilities; they are not necessarily equivalent in terms of capability or role to UKSF. Commanders and staff must understand where NATO SOF and UKSF differ and plan accordingly. The description here is focused on that of UKSf, with key differences to NATO doctrine highlighted.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Special forces operations are underpinned by a number of characteristics. Precision allows them to provide military options in situations that require a tailored and focused effect. Operations are conducted with tempo to gain and retain the initiative. Maintained at very high readiness, special forces have the agility to enable responsive strategic and operational deployment. They also have the ability to operate at reach, globally, in the most hostile and politically complex environments beyond the capabilities of many conventional force elements. Special forces levels of endurance allow operations to be conducted in hostile environments for extended periods, isolated from main combat forces and surviving on relatively limited resources. Operators accept a commensurately high level of individual and collective physical risk. Special forces maintain high levels of secrecy in respect of their operations, capabilities, information and personnel.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Special forces are a scarce and valuable resource. UKSF and NATO SOF are employed according to similar enduring principles. Used for strategic effect, they are commanded at the highest appropriate level and involved in the earliest stages of planning to enable timely decision-making. They are provided with access to the best intelligence available and have their security protected.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Special forces have three broadly defined roles, each of which has a number of associated tasks or activities. surveillance and reconnaissance delivers strategic insight, support to planning, target development, assessment and liaison. support and influence is achieved through capacity building of security forces, military assistance to irregular forces, civil-military cooperation and information activities. Offensive action seeks to seize, destroy, capture or inflict damage to an opponent’s offensive capability or infrastructure to create specific and often time-sensitive effects. It includes sabotage, raids, strikes and ambushes, counter-terrorism, and bespoke operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
UKSF, while maintaining specific protocols for their own operations, in a joint context apply operational level planning processes. The Special forces Component Commander and Special forces Task Group Commander, represented by a Special Operations Planning and Liaison element or Special forces Cell, should be involved in the planning process from the outset so that advice on capability and the best use of scarce resource can be included within the evolving campaign design. They can then support and shape the operation, within the freedoms and constraints laid down in the operational directive. In an operational environment, liaison officers are also likely to be deployed to land (and other) component headquarters to advise on the coordination, integration and de-confliction of special forces’ activities as required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
While a significant force multiplier, special forces have limitations. Special forces are small in number and must be employed appropriately, focusing effect at critical times and places. They are not a substitute for land forces, which have greater mass and firepower, and can potentially be reconstituted more quickly. They should not be employed for tasks which may appear attractive, but against which conventional forces are more appropriate. As a finite resource with a relatively high cost to train and equip, UKSF will routinely be assigned to the strategic main effort. Although UKSF can operate for extended periods in hostile territory, they do not generally hold ground. However, through integrated planning and execution of operations special forces may magnify the effectiveness of land operations in a joint context.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Access to intelligence, sustainment and means of force projection are all key dependencies for special forces. They are normally deployed against high value targets, often at short notice, and require intelligence of the highest fidelity. The nature of special forces operations also requires bespoke and flexible sustainment. This tends to be small-scale but more complex compared to that of conventional forces. finally air support is a critical enabler for special forces operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The logistic component is an essential element of all operations. Unlike the environmental components, it is not tied to a specific Service but is inherently joint. It also differs in that it exists only at the operational level; it is an integral part of an end-to-end system, from industry to deployed tactical force elements. At the tactical level, land forces are, therefore, unlikely to interact with the logistic component in the same manner as with, for example, maritime, air or special forces components. Land forces must, however, understand the construct of the logistic component and its relationship with land component’s logistic force elements, which together inform the land approach to sustainment. The planning and execution of sustainment in the land environment is the subject of Chapter 10.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The logistic component is responsible for all logistic activity at the operational level. It supports the activities of the combat components, which are usually responsible for tactical level sustainment specific to their operating environment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In a multinational context, logistic arrangements are complex and need to be agreed and established in advance of operations. By default the sustainment of national forces in a multinational operation is a national responsibility. However, nations should explore opportunities for cooperation to reduce duplication of effort. Such arrangements may include appointing a lead logistic or framework nation, or appointing particular roles to contributing nations. In multinational operations, each nation establishes a national support element in support of their national contingent. The activities of the various national support elements are de-conflicted and coordinated at the operational level by a multinational logistic headquarters, on NATO operations called the joint logistic support group. On UK-led operations requiring more than specialist augmentation of a JTF headquarters, a logistic component is formed. This component, or a national support element in a multinational operations, may be founded on the UK Joint force Logistic Component (JfLogC), an existing logistic formation or a bespoke headquarters.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustainment in the land environment can be very complex and resource-intensive, depending on the type of operation, the scale and types of forces involved, the distances to be covered and the threats posed by both the physical environment and enemy action. These factors inform the relationship of the logistic component with land component logistic force elements. At the very least, a close and formalised cooperative arrangement with the deployed logistic brigade or lead logistic unit is required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The logistic component has several generic functions. These include theatre activation, movement control, certain in-theatre movement and life support tasks (for example, reception, staging and onward integration), force supply and distribution, the reverse supply chain, contractor support and personnel policy. Tactical level logistic, equipment, health services, infrastructure and administrative support are normally conducted by the individual components, but require coordination across the wider joint operations area. They also are often optimised by drawing on skills available across the joint force and through the whole force approach.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The factors above and the character of contemporary conflict shape the approach to sustainment in the land environment, which has five elements.
a. Sustainment is focused on support to expeditionary operations. Although there may be requirements to sustain military activity within the UK, the focus of sustainment doctrine, training and preparation is on expeditionary operations.
b. Sustainment is a fundamentally joint activity. In order to deploy forces and sustain them in an expeditionary environment, the end-to-end support chain is predominantly joint. It is only forward of the deployed joint supply area that sustainment activity becomes the responsibility of the land component commander.
c. Sustainment is delivered through a range of military, civilian and allied capabilities (the whole force approach). Sustaining UK land forces requires capabilities that frequently are only available from reserve, contract, host nation and allied resources.
d. The UK has adopted the NATO principles of logistics to enhance interoperability and reflect the NATO underpinning of UK defence. These are described in Chapter 10.
e. Sustainment activities must be designed and executed in the context of Integrated Action. The actions of the logistic component and of land logistic force elements have intended and unintended consequences beyond those directly contributing to the sustainment of the land force. for example, the delivery of humanitarian aid, a convoy of logistics vehicles or the disembarkation of main battle tanks in a foreign port, can all be observed by the audience. Alternatively, the establishment of sustainment nodes and capabilities, along with use of locally sourced contractors, can reassure the local audience of our commitment to security, stabilisation and the local economy. Conversely, sustainment activities can inadvertently lead to corruption, in particular contracting and employment of local civilians, and potentially undermine longer-term political success.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces operate in an increasingly complex environment, where information technologies continue to transform how land forces operate with, among and against other actors. Cyberspace in particular presents significant opportunities and threats. Integrated Action is enhanced by cyberspace’s ubiquitous, interconnected and dynamic nature. These same factors, however, also enable threats such as espionage, sabotage and subversion. There is no cyber component matched to this environment (as there is for the physical environments of maritime, land and air). Rather, cyberspace pervades all operations and so responsibility for exploiting its potential and protecting from its threats is common to all components.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Joint doctrine defines cyberspace as: an operating environment consisting of the interdependent network of digital technology infrastructures (including platforms, the Internet, telecommunication networks, computer systems, as well as embedded processors and controllers), and the data therein spanning the physical, virtual and cognitive domains.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The cyber operating environment of platforms, networks and systems is critical to operations, and can be explained by reference to near, mid and far operating spaces. The near space is controlled and assured by a particular commander. The mid and far spaces are not; the mid includes systems operated by other government departments, or commercial companies; the far lies predominantly outside the control or assurance of friendly actors and is likely to be owned by third party or hostile actors.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are four roles identified with cyber operations: defensive cyber operations (DCO), comprising active and passive measures; cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (cyber ISR); offensive cyber operations (OCO); and cyber operational preparation of the environment (cyber OPE).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyberspace and the electromagnetic environment (eMe) must be considered together. electromagnetic activity can be used to affect the ability of other actors to operate in cyberspace, and vice versa. The eMe, however, is focused on activity in the virtual domain, while cyberspace also spans the physical, including, for example, the computer cables that carry data traffic. The term cyber electromagnetic activities (CEMA) refers to the integration of activities in cyberspace and the EME, as illustrated in figure 1.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The full range of activities is usually only conducted and orchestrated at the divisional level and above. At lower levels, land forces will either execute specific CEMA or integrate their own actions with CEMA executed by other organisations. In all cases, land forces must consider the effects of cyberspace and the EME on their particular operating environment and the actors within it.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyberspace and the EME provide the medium through which operations are planned and also, increasingly, executed. They affect land forces of all types and at all levels, from the lowest tactical grouping using networked, digital communication systems and global positioning systems (GPS) to higher tactical formations resourced to orchestrate cyber activities within Integrated Action. Protection and exploitation of cyberspace and EME are, therefore, fundamental to all operations. Considerations for land forces include the following.
a. Whether near, mid or far, cyberspace is contested. Hostile actors constantly probe our systems to seek vulnerabilities, intelligence and advantage. Land forces must protect against cyber attack, while remaining capable of planning and executing operations with reduced or denied access to cyberspace and the eMe. This could include operating for periods of time without GPS navigation, tactical data or secure voice networks, or the ability to communicate with the home base.
b. The increasing global accessibility of cyberspace, low relative cost (when compared with more traditional capabilities) and difficulty in attributing attacks means that its exploitation is not limited to peer competitors, but to almost all potential adversaries. Also, land forces and those we wish to protect are increasingly and routinely dependent on cyberspace as a matter of daily life. Cyber factors must be considered in land forces’ planning.
c. Most electronic control systems have cyber vulnerabilities, even if not all are readily exploitable. Cyber attacks can cause damage not only in the virtual domain, manipulating information, but also in the physical domain. They can be used to affect directly electronically-controlled systems, from equipment to infrastructure.
d. Actions in cyberspace and the eMe can have a broad range of effects in time and space, as part of all tactical functions. Unconstrained by physical environments, their range can be almost without limit and they can take effect either instantaneously, over a longer period or be programmed for subsequent activation. These factors provide significant opportunities through Integrated Action.
e. UK offensive cyber electromagnetic activities are conducted within the same legal framework as operations in the physical domain. Actions taken in cyberspace can, however, be ambiguous and publicly deniable, allowing hostile actors to remain below thresholds traditionally associated with entering armed conflict.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In a cyber context, multinational and inter-agency interoperability is particularly challenging. However, since the effects of actions taken in cyberspace and the EME are not necessarily geographically bounded, de-confliction and mutual understanding are imperative. National and commercial sensitivities surround specific electronic counter measures, cyber and electronic warfare capabilities; and, with the exception of spectrum management, there is currently no common, NATO approach to cyber electromagnetic activities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At the operational or higher tactical level, corps and divisions orchestrate Integrated Action and align their activity with joint, inter-agency and multinational operations. The orchestration of operations concerns the direction and arrangement of actions, sequentially and simultaneously, to create desired effects. Brigades, units and other force elements, operating at the tactical level, plan and execute their contributions to the divisional operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
This Chapter builds on Chapter 4, describing in general how operations are planned and conducted to achieve Integrated Action; Volumes 1 and 3 of the AfM series provide greater detail. It begins by describing the overall process of operational design and tactical planning at different levels. It then describes the fundamental building blocks of a land force’s capabilities, the tactical functions. It introduces how operational art connects objectives, over time, to achieve desired outcomes. The next section explains the doctrinal frameworks, which aid the integration of actions and effects to achieve objectives. It concludes with a summary of the tactical activities that contribute to Integrated Action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In integrated Action the land force draws together all the levers of power and influence available to it. These include those levers exercised by friendly actors and those integral to the land force, which are described by the tactical functions. It applies them (through doctrinal frameworks and tactical activities) to have the effects required to achieve assigned objectives and outcomes. These objectives and outcomes, however, are rarely, if ever, achieved by a single cycle of actions and effects. At the higher tactical level and above, military operations invariably require multiple lines of activity and sequences of objectives and actions – each one dependent on prior activity. Operational art, described later in this chapter, guides the planning and management of operations at this level. The emphasis in this publication is to describe how tactical activities should be conducted so that they contribute to wider operational and therefore strategic outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Effective operations rely on appropriate and constantly updated understanding of the context of the situation, the audience, and the information and physical environment. Understanding is specific to role. for example the land component commander, a staff officer in a logistics unit, a battlegroup operations officer and an engineer reconnaissance sergeant all need to know different things. It is very important, but relatively straightforward, to develop understanding of the physical environment and many aspects of the information environment. Critical to the design of effective operations, and to eventual success, is understanding the audience (the human aspect of the environment), which is far more challenging. further detail on the theory and process of understanding is at Annex 8A.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Figure 4-1 illustrates how the audience consists of all those relevant to the attainment of objectives: the wider audience, actors, adversaries and enemies. The first stage in operations design and tactical planning is to understand not only the problem and task, but to understand enough of the relevant audience to judge what actions within the force’s power will stimulate behaviour in a way that leads to achieving the desired outcomes. It is also vital to try and anticipate what actors might do, including to us, recognising that there will always be uncertainty. Action is often the best way of developing understanding, and is certainly the way to begin to take the initiative. In an area of operations, the audience could consist of enemies, adversaries, actors, and other groups or individuals that are not active in the situation, or about to be, but are still members of the audience. There are many tools used to assist with understanding the human aspect of the environment. Centre of gravity analysis can be a useful tool particularly for understanding what an actor’s capabilities, requirements and vulnerabilities are. The concept is described at Annex 8B. Outside the area of operations is a wider audience that must be considered; depending on the situation, this wider audience could be important to the course and outcome of the whole operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A key responsibility for commanders at all levels is shaping the context for their part of the operation. Through responsible and constructive dialogue with their ‘one-up’ commanders and the staff, and when possible by engagement in the ‘one- up’ planning process, subordinates can make success more likely. They are able to influence the enabling actions of their superiors, adjust the resources available to them, shape expectations about the likely achievements of their force, and gain the support and confidence of their commanders. Those with operational-level responsibilities must go further, complementing the actions of government, senior military officers, and diplomatic and civilian officials. By direct communication, and information activities (including through the media) they can shape the context of the entire venture by influencing relevant actors to assist the force, directly or indirectly.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
One of the challenges of designing operations is the integration of lethal and non- lethal effects. The means at the disposal of the land force (the tactical functions) do not all have matched or easily assessed effects. Integrated Action aims to create effects on actors’ understanding, physical capability, and will and cohesion. These effects range from those that are intended to be wholly constructive and positive such as through training the forces of a partner (capacity building and information activities), to those intended to be destructively negative such as defeating an enemy force (fires and manoeuvre, accelerated by information activities). Some effects can be more or less immediate (such as from the use of fires); others can be very long term (again, capacity building is a good example). In both these examples, we can be confident that our actions have led to the changed state of the actors concerned. In other cases the connection is less clear; this is a particular issue for some forms of information activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Tactical planning for combined arms tactical activities is more straightforward. formations, units and other force elements are given missions and tasks that contribute to the higher commander’s plan and fulfil its intent. These are designed as discrete actions to achieve specified conditions, or subordinate objectives and outcomes, as part of the overall plan. for this lower-level activity to contribute fully and appropriately to the overall plan, it is essential that commanders and staff at unit and sub-unit level understand the context of their actions, their division and brigade commanders’ intent and plans, their own contributions, and the likely wider consequences of their actions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operations design and tactical planning lead to the scheme of manoeuvre and provide the basis for control of the operation (Annex 8C describes different operations themes and types of operation). Plans are continuously reviewed and refined; the situation will change, in response to actions, reactions and the unavoidable consequences of chance and friction. Commanders insure against uncertainty, the unpredictable opportunities and risks that will arise, by preparing contingency plans and assigning reserves.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The tactical functions represent the full breadth of a land force’s activities when conducting operations. They are: command, intelligence, manoeuvre, fires, information activities, capacity building, protection and sustainment. The tactical functions are a device that helps to organise activities into intelligible groups; they have no effects, whereas the activities do. few, if any stand alone. All activity needs to be commanded and sustained for example. However, the bigger and more combined arms the force is, the more likely it is to have the ability for significant activity under every heading. As a rule of thumb, corps and divisions are designed to conduct all the tactical functions simultaneously. Subordinate force elements may be able to apply all the functions to lesser degrees or specific ones to great effect. for example, an engineer unit has less access to fires than a combined arms battlegroup, which in turn may have fewer opportunities for capacity building than one scaled for security force assistance tasks. The tactical functions also provide a useful checklist for commanders when assessing a plan, and a common vocabulary for describing a force’s overall capabilities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Each of the descriptions that follow describes the functions generically; they are intended to apply from division to sub-unit level. each describes the activities grouped under the function, and the sort of effects the activities might have. figure 8-1 illustrates how the functions fall into three groups organised by purpose. Command and intelligence activities are largely internally focused, setting and maintaining the direction of the operation or action; manoeuvre, fires, information activities and capacity building are mainly directed at those relevant to the outcome of the operation; and protection and sustainment are the activities that enable the operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Command is the tactical function that enables
all other tactical functions. It is through command that the tactical functions are balanced, resourced and directed when orchestrating and contributing to Integrated Action. It encompasses the authority of appointed individuals and the ways and means by which authority is exercised (through decision making, leadership, control, using information as a resource, and communication systems). Other activities that have a significant information element are covered by the tactical functions of intelligence, information activities, fires and protection.
a. The command and control aspect includes; interaction with other force elements, their commanders and staff; effective planning; the management and execution of operations and tactical activities, including battle procedure; the design and management of command and control relationships within the force, and battlespace management; and the design, organisation and location of command posts.
b. The use and transmission of information are also aspects of the command tactical function. Managing the force’s information as a resource (information management and exploitation), and establishing and maintaining assured information to the point of need within the force (command and information systems) are both critical to operational success at all levels. A coherent, robust and secure network of information services, as illustrated in figure 8-2, underpins the effectiveness of all tactical functions. Given the centrality of command to land forces’ doctrine, Chapter 6 describes Mission Command and Chapter 9 explains the application of command.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Intelligence is the tactical function that makes the most significant contribution to understanding. Intelligence is a product, a critical resource that is used to inform the force’s activities. Relevant information is gathered and kept updated about the audience and actors, adversaries and enemies, the information environment and the physical aspects of the area of intelligence interest. Intelligence as a tactical function encompasses the activities of commanders, staff and collection assets to generate intelligence product. Those involved do this by giving direction on requirements and, following collection and processing, disseminating the product in a timely manner to inform operations.
a. Intelligence activity is guided by the intelligence collection plan, which is constructed to meet the commander’s intelligence requirements. This prioritisation is essential to focus activity on the needs of the operation, because of the abundance of information and the friction inherent in conflict. Commanders require intelligence about the characteristics, culture, capabilities, locations, intentions, relationships and objectives of the audience whose understanding and behaviour they seek to influence. Intelligence about the information and physical aspects of the land environment supports commanders’ understanding of the freedoms and constraints affecting operations.
b. The tactical function includes collecting information through intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) activity. This includes activity, for example, by force elements responsible for electronic surveillance and human intelligence. It also includes specialist ISR activity by manned and unmanned aircraft, armoured and light cavalry, artillery and combat engineer special-to-arm capabilities, and battlegroup close reconnaissance. But they do not have sole responsibility for ISR activity. The whole force contributes to generating intelligence from all parts of the area of operations. Increasingly, open source information is also highly relevant in informing tactical decisions.
c. Information about the relevant audience, the information environment and the physical geography is passed to the relevant staff both to inform immediate tactical decisions and for more considered analysis. Analysis of information about these subjects is fused to provide commanders with a common intelligence picture to inform decision-making. The analysis of privileged or highly classified information is just one element of intelligence, which also exploits the potential of ever-improving technical processing tools applied to the wealth of open source information.
d. Dissemination is the activity that distributes relevant information to those who need it, in time to inform their decisions and actions. This balances ‘need to know’ with ‘responsibility to share’.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Above all, intelligence collection is continuous. Dynamic and adversarial situations constantly evolve, previous truths can rapidly become ill-founded assumptions, and adversaries will actively seek to deceive. It is vital that commanders give significant attention to formulating their information and intelligence requirements; amendments may reduce the tempo of a force and add undue friction. Nevertheless, these requirements must be responsive to the situation and kept under constant review.

Manoeuvre is the employment of forces on the battlefield through movement in combination with fire, or fire potential, to achieve a position of advantage in respect to the enemy to accomplish the mission. The tactical function involves physical movement and positioning of force elements over land, water or through the air.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Manoeuvre can have a range of unique effects, because only it can allow forces to take possession of terrain. Through the Manoeuvrist Approach it offers the means of concentrating force or the threat of force decisively in time and space to achieve surprise and shock, and create opportunities for exploitation. Manoeuvre can have an effect that compels adversaries to respond by acting in ways that are not in their interests. In stability operations, placing or moving forces to reassure or provide security is a form of manoeuvre as much as manoeuvre in combat. Manoeuvre is also often an important element of deception (for example, a feint) or deterrence (for example, a show of force). It can be used precisely against physical and human targets (for example, in a raid, or targeted search). Manoeuvre, therefore, contributes to Integrated Action through its effects on actors’ understanding, physical capability, and will and cohesion.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Manoeuvre enables and is enabled by activities grouped under the other tactical functions. Command and intelligence direct it. In combat, organic and supporting fires are the critical enablers, helping to generate shock and demoralisation that manoeuvre can exploit. Information activities can be used to magnify its impact. Protection activities may conceal it to help generate surprise, and sustainment is always essential.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land manoeuvre is the combination of ground and air manoeuvre enabled by manoeuvre support. Ground manoeuvre is best conducted by combined arms forces, appropriate to the terrain and task. Air manoeuvre can act as an accelerant to ground manoeuvre, or be decisive itself, supported by ground manoeuvre. for example, ground forces can disrupt or destroy enemy air defences and open up avenues of approach for exploitation by air manoeuvre forces. Alternatively, air manoeuvre forces can seize, clear and hold key terrain to enable exploitation by ground manoeuvre forces. Manoeuvre takes different forms: frontal, penetration, infiltration, envelopment and turning movements. These are explained in the AfM series.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The tactical function of fires refers to the use of weapons to create a specific lethal or non-lethal effect on a target. Without fires, armed organisations have no force to apply or threaten. Lethal fires include the direct and indirect weapon systems of land, maritime and air forces designed to destroy, neutralise or suppress an enemy. This definition includes the organic fires of manoeuvre forces: small arms, anti-tank and structure missiles, mortars, and the main armament of armoured fighting vehicles. However, this tactical function is mainly concerned with fires directed and controlled at all levels of command, particularly the fires available to a corps or division, mainly provided by air, attack helicopters and artillery. Non- lethal fires include offensive cyber electromagnetic activities that have physical effects. These may, for example, degrade or deny electronically-controlled systems, including communication and information systems as well as other equipment and <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fires have immediate effects on both precise and area targets, including destroying, fixing, disrupting or dislocating enemy forces. More importantly, when applied effectively at the right time and place, they have secondary effects on an enemy’s will and cohesion. fires can have a devastating effect on enemy morale. They can also be used to destroy, damage or influence critical physical and virtual resources, nodes and linkages that form part of an enemy force’s cohesion. They can also be used to bolster the will and cohesion of friendly actors.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fires are closely dependent on other tactical functions. They rely on actionable intelligence and the post-engagement assessment that it provides. fires are essential to enable manoeuvre, but the two enhance each other. As part of shaping actions, fires are sometimes used independently, but they are more likely to be used in conjunction with ISR and information activities. Attack helicopters and artillery are a critical capability of any force and therefore a priority for protection. They also generate significant sustainment demand.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
From battlegroup mortars upwards, for fires to be most effective they are commanded at the highest level but controlled at the lowest appropriate levels, to optimise concentration of force and responsiveness. When fires support manoeuvre forces, for example, the manoeuvre commander controls the fires, but seldom commands them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As a tactical function, information activities covers all the ways of deliberately communicating messages to the audience. They have a common purpose – to affect understanding. The activities grouped under this tactical function include psychological operations, engagement, deception, cyber electromagnetic activity, media operations, and presence, posture and profile. All of these can have first as well as second order effects on behaviours and are fundamental to Integrated Action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Information activities should be used to enhance and exploit the effects of manoeuvre, fires and capacity building; indeed if this is not done, these physical activities do not achieve their full potential. As any actions detectable by the audience are a form of communication, they can be used to support and substantiate information activities. Information activities do not only enhance our own actions, they can limit enemies’ and adversaries’ ability to exploit their own successes, and be pivotal in protecting the cohesion of our force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Key to the success of information activities is coherence and consistency of messages and actions, from the strategic to tactical levels. This requires the active involvement of the whole force, using Mission Command to align the force with the overall commander’s intent. The conduct of certain information activities requires specialist knowledge and skills, much of which comes from outside the British Army. Commanders at all levels have a responsibility to integrate that expertise within the force. Notwithstanding the specialist aspects of Information Activities, the entire force has a role to play, for example, in engagement (direct communication to or dialogue with the audience), deception, and media operations, as well as conforming to the force’s required presence, posture and profile.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
For all the benefits of information activities, commanders and staff at all levels should be aware of the risks, which include varying interpretations, and the unpredictability of subsequent effects. even a consistent set of messages can be complicated by varying interpretations. The presence of tanks in a particular village during a peace support operation may, for instance, send conflicting messages: to one audience it may reassure; to another it may suggest an insecure environment. The first order effects of a message designed to be relatively immediate are often assessable: for example, a division commander’s phone call to a key actor may stimulate observable action, or a battlegroup’s deception plan might be successful in fixing an enemy reserve. However, the subsequent effects are hard, perhaps impossible, to predict. Longer term messaging, perhaps to wider audiences, is also hard to gauge, and is more vulnerable to counter-messaging. Therefore, effective information activities require considerable understanding of the audience, and continuous monitoring and assessment by specialist intelligence activity. This enables land forces to adapt their activities to remain in step with the changing understanding and behaviours of audience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although many aspects of information activities are conducted or reflected by all elements of the force, their nature means that the divisional headquarters is normally the lowest level of command with access to the full range of capabilities and the means to command and control them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Capacity building, as a tactical function, concerns those actions taken to improve military, and when necessary civil, security and infrastructure capability. Security capacity building often involves training host nation partner forces. Advise and assist tasks involve the provision of support to help the partner build their capability, including institutionally. Accompany tasks involve partnering on operations. Infrastructure capacity building may require reconstructing or repairing infrastructure that has been damaged during combat operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Capacity building has first order effects on actors’ behaviours and their fighting Power. It can also have second order effects through developing capabilities that subsequently contribute to behavioural outcomes. Normally, unlike manoeuvre and fires, security capacity building takes a long time, perhaps years, to have lasting effect, as it involves building fighting Power. Like all other physical activity, capacity building enhances and is enhanced and exploited by information activities. It also requires a comprehensive (or between UK agencies, full-spectrum approach), to work in harmony with UK, host nation and sometimes Allied governmental and other agencies. even direct assistance to host nation military forces is inherently political in nature and but one line of wider security development which necessarily involves non-military actors. Cooperation between the land force and other actors is essential for creating unity of effort.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The requirement and opportunity to conduct capacity building depends on the size of the land force involved, its tasks and the type of operation. A land force may conduct capacity building as a discrete type of operation, where capacity building activities are likely to be the main effort, supported by the other tactical functions. In other types of operation, dependent on resources and requirement, land forces will either deliver capacity building as a tactical function directly, or support or be supported by others doing so.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The tactical function of protection refers to those actions taken to protect the fighting Power of a force. These include physical and information protection activities and measures. It has two inter-related purposes: to enable freedom of action; and to maintain operational effectiveness by preserving combat power (people, equipment, materiel, installations and information).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Protection depends on continually refreshed understanding of the risks facing the force and the level of risk appetite. It is important to understand, mitigate and protect both the vulnerabilities of one’s own centre of gravity, and threats posed by adversaries and the environment. These inform the level and application of physical and information protection measures required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Physical protection is created by a combination of activities and force protection measures. The activities are actions taken to protect the force from enemy ISR and attack. These include guards, screens, air defence, concealment and counter- chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear (CBRN) measures. In addition, commanders select appropriate force protection measures. These include equipment and procedures to reduce the likelihood of casualties, and procedures to reduce non-battle injuries and ill-health. Information protection requires appropriate measures of operational and information security. Care is required to ensure that a vigorous approach to protection does not undermine other key objectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Critically, the moral component of the force must also be protected. In the same way as the Manoeuvrist Approach emphasises effects on an enemy’s cohesion and will to fight, so too must we protect our own will and cohesion. The physical and information protection measures described are necessary, but not sufficient for maintaining the force’s moral component, which is developed over time, before and during operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustainment enables land forces to operate and provides them with freedom of action, by providing for the personnel, logistics, equipment, medical and other support required to conduct operations. Sustainment consists of supplying a force with consumables and replacing combat losses and non-combat attrition of equipment to maintain the force’s combat power for the duration required to meet its objectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustainment is a key enabler of Integrated Action. Without sustainment, military operations and Integrated Action simply are not possible. In particular, manoeuvre and fires often generate very high demand, particularly in combat, so assured sustainment is critical to success in battle. Sustainment, therefore, is central to commanders’ decision-making, as they have to balance the desired effects with the resources available. Sustainment is not only an enabler of Integrated Action; it can also contribute to its outcomes. How a land force sustains itself, whether it draws resource from a host nation, which port of entry is used and what local contracts are established are all considerations that can have positive and negative, intended and unintended consequences in relation to actors’ behaviour. It is, therefore, dependent on intelligence and can complement information activities, offering economic substance to narratives. Sustainment is the subject of Chapter 10.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operational art is defined as the employment of forces to attain strategic and/or operational objectives through the design, organisation, integration and conduct of strategies, campaigns, major operations and battles. It is the orchestration of a series of tactical actions, if necessary along multiple tactical lines of activity. Operational art is often regarded as an aspect of command at the operational (joint) level. It is described here because although its understanding and application is implicit to land force commanders with operational-level responsibilities, tactical commanders also need to understand it. It informs the design of the campaign or operation to which they contribute, and is therefore the source of their higher commander’s intent. It is also relevant as a tool at the tactical level, when sequencing multiple tactical activities to achieve objectives, which in turn contribute to operational level outcomes. This is often relevant in the case of a unit with long-term responsibilities for an area of operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At the land component level, and usually at the higher tactical (corps and division) level, operational art translates strategic direction into tactical execution. The land force contributes to joint campaign decisive conditions, which leads to achieving the desired end state. This means that it is the principal way in which tactical activities are designed and managed in concert with other agencies. Operational art in the contemporary land operating environment is, therefore, the orchestration (design and management) of Integrated Action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operations design establishes the sequence and purpose of critical actions, assigning missions and priorities to subordinates and supporting commands. These actions are nested within, and contribute to, the higher commander’s objectives – a requirement that may cause tension in a multinational environment when balancing national and operational command requirements, but which should not be overlooked. Operations design leads to the scheme of manoeuvre and provides the basis for control of the operation (Annex 8C describes different types of operation). Operations design, through review and refinement, is continuous; the situation will change, so the operation and the force must adapt in response to actions, reactions and the unavoidable consequences of chance and friction. Commanders on enduring operations accept that their periods in charge cover only a proportion of a longer campaign. This requires a high degree of humility in command and awareness of the context for individual contributions. It does not routinely require a re-design of a campaign, operation or even tactical activities every time commanders and staffs change over or troops are relieved.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As explained in the operational overview (paragraphs 8-03–8-09), Integrated Action requires operations design that aligns actions, effects and objectives with desired outcomes. each level of the land force nests its activity under the superior level; indeed some force elements in some circumstances may not even have outcomes: the successful attainment of their objectives may contribute to higher level outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operations management integrates, coordinates, synchronises and prioritises the execution of activities within operations and assesses their progress. Adversary and enemy responses will inevitably affect the course of a campaign or operation, as will those of other actors. Assessing the course of the operation, then acting quickly in order to modify the plan to meet objectives in a new light, is the essence of successful operations management.
Doctrinal frameworks
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders, having developed their understanding of the desired outcomes and the relevant audiences, then assess what objectives need to be achieved, and by what effects. In visualising and explaining how actions, effects and objectives contribute to achieving the outcome, commanders design their operations using one of the three doctrinal frameworks. The operational and tactical frameworks group actions by their desired effects, and the geographic framework describes where activities take place in relation to the force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The operational and tactical frameworks are closely related, as illustrated in figure 1.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The operational framework is suited to situations demanding more deliberate planning, whereas the tactical framework is better suited to relatively simple situations involving hasty planning. for combat missions, relatively well bounded in terms of time, space and purpose, the tactical framework is the norm at battlegroup level and below. It is also used at higher levels for specific tasks. for more complex or enduring missions, the operational framework has broader applicability, from sub-unit level upwards.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The operational framework comprises decisive, shaping and sustaining actions underpinned throughout by continuous understanding. At any level of command, it describes how the missions and tasks of subordinates interact in terms of their purposes and contribution to what is decisive. Decisive actions are those that are essential to the achievement of the mission. Understanding, shaping and sustaining actions support those that are decisive and often endure throughout an operation. By applying the operational framework, commanders and staff ensure their concept of operations is balanced and able to have a clear and unambiguous main effort.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Actions to enable understanding precede and continue throughout an operation. They are designed firstly to assess the context of the operation, the relevant audience, and the information and physical aspects of the environment. Until this is done, it is not possible to estimate the likely consequences of our actions and those of other actors with confidence. Understanding must be continually reviewed and updated as it allows the force to respond to threats in time, and is the basis for adaptation. Understanding is mainly conducted by the activities covered by the tactical function of intelligence, directed by command. In combat operations, understanding includes locating, identifying, tracking and assessing an adversary or applying these skills to a situation, for example, the mood of a population. Whether establishing understanding or more simply finding the enemy, this is not simply a preliminary stage to operations but continuous; a land force’s actions necessarily generate responses from actors and adversaries, which feed constantly updated understanding. The context will suggest how to generate understanding, perhaps through early deployment of specialist forces or analysis of information and intelligence already collected. In some cases, active information gathering may compromise subsequent shaping actions; in others, spurring a reaction may be essential to generate understanding for shaping or decisive actions. Commanders, therefore, express not only what they seek to understand, but also how the intelligence operation is to be conducted. More detail on the process of understanding is at Annex 8A.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Shaping actions create or preserve the conditions required for what is decisive to the mission. These conditions may relate to a broad or targeted part of the audience and hostile, neutral or friendly actors.
a. Shaping actions can relate to other actors, the environment or the land force itself. The commander may need to shape the audience and actors outside the force to gain support or more resources for the operation, as described in paragraph 5.Within the force, a shaping action might include using fires to destroy or neutralise elements of enemy forces; moving into a preliminary position; denying enemy approaches; constructing infrastructure; linking up with friendly forces; or reinforcing a partner force. In audience-focused shaping actions, the purpose is to influence behaviours in our favour, such as fixing an enemy (see below), or gaining the support of an influential local actor. In all cases, land forces can draw on all or some combinations of the tactical functions, particularly manoeuvre, fires and information activities.
b. Fixing is a key shaping action in combat and many adversarial situations. To fix is to deny adversaries their goals, distract them and thus deprive them of their freedom of action. This increases our own freedom of action. Adversaries who have no freedom of action cannot dictate the course of tactical events; they have lost the initiative. Depriving them of their freedom of action has both physical and psychological aspects. Physically, their force can be blocked, or pinned against an obstacle. Psychologically, they are fixed if they believe they have no freedom of action, if they feel compelled to do something, or if they believe they have to persist with something that in practice will not bring them success. Often the easiest way to fix adversaries is to threaten something that they must protect. Deception may fix them until it is too late for them to regain the initiative. fixing can be broken down further.
(1) Denial of goals. A commander can gain freedom of action by preventing adversaries from achieving their goals and by putting them in a reactive frame of mind. The aim is to constrain them and throw them off-balance. The principal means are to surprise, deceive and lure. When adversaries are surprised, they will be uncertain how to react, possibly until it is too late. When they are deceived, they may be confident in acting, but their confidence will be misplaced. The lure invites them to take a course of action which makes them vulnerable.
(2) Distraction. freedom of action may be gained by distracting adversaries, to reduce their ability to interfere with operations. Uncertain of their opponent’s objectives, distracted adversaries may try to cover all options, thereby dissipating their force and being driven off their intended purpose.
(3) Deprivation of freedom of action. A target can be fixed by being denied information, sustainment, or the ability to pass orders and to co-ordinate actions and effects. In an insurgency this can be achieved by separating insurgents from their support. In any fixing activity designed to cut down an opponent’s freedom of action, their command and control system, combat service support, and ability to manoeuvre or focus effort are the primary targets.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Decisive action or actions are those essential to achieve the mission; without them, the mission is unlikely to succeed. enabled by understanding and shaping actions, and critically reliant on sustaining actions, they can be terrain or actor focused, or both. There may be a single decisive action, short in duration, or a series of events over a protracted period. In both cases, what is decisive informs the unifying purpose of supporting, enabling and subordinate formations and units and is integral to achieving the higher commander’s intent; it contains the main effort. Decisive actions usually require the use of manoeuvre, fires, and information activities and have two elements – engagement and exploitation.
a. In combat situations, engagement usually includes offensive or defensive tactical activities. for example, in defence a force may block an adversary and so set the conditions for a counter-attack. Or, engagement may be through attacking in order to defeat an adversary. In non-adversarial operations, engagement seeks to affect behaviours positively, without the use of force. engagement is seldom decisive unless vigorously exploited, and opportunities for decisive exploitation can arise without engagement occurring.
b. Making the most of exploitation opportunities, whether created through successful engagement or chance, relies upon an ability not only to identify them but to be able to generate the means to exploit them. Opportunities vary according to the nature of the operation, from identifying a gap in a main defence to sensing an armed group’s interest in switching sides. It can also include intelligence exploitation after achieving an objective. These opportunities are to be sought out, not waited for. The seizure of these opportunities needs to be consolidated, using reserves and forces in echelon, not least to avoid culmination or being counter-attacked from a flank. Subordinates are encouraged and enabled to exploit opportunities that arise or that they create, in accordance with Mission Command. exploitation requires commanders with initiative, decisiveness and a readiness to do the unexpected; it depends on effective understanding, which in turn requires capable intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance forces. A final element of any exploitation is assessment, taking stock, so that opportunities and threats are recognised and balanced.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustaining actions (broadly reflected by the tactical functions of sustainment and protection) enable land forces to survive, move and fight so that they can conduct understanding, decisive or shaping actions. Sustaining actions include supply, repair, medical, administrative and infrastructure support; reception into theatre; the assembly, movement and security of reserves or echelon forces; redeployment of forces out of contact; host nation support; the establishment and protection of own vulnerabilities, such as operating bases or lines of communication; and support for, and protection of, civilians and civilian installations. Sustaining is also about protection, through a balance of active measures to neutralise a threat and defensive measures, which include guarding, dispersal, camouflage and deception.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The tactical framework is a simplified version of the operational framework. It is based on four core functions: find, fix, strike and exploit. The tactical framework is designed for use against an enemy in combat operations, but can be adapted to other situations. To conform to the Manoeuvrist Approach, these core functions are conducted rapidly and in a seamless sequence. This requires anticipation and concurrent activity; part of good battle procedure. The tactical framework can also be adapted to other military activity at battlegroup level and below. finding is as much about gaining a contextual understanding as it is about locating an enemy unit. fixing can be achieved by a range of methods that deny enemies recourse to their desired courses of action, for example, by reducing their popular support. Striking may involve violent offensive action, or entail the launch of activity aimed at influencing an enemy’s perceptions or those of their supporters. At the lower tactical level, where problems are usually relatively simple and immediate, the tactical framework is often the best framework for conducting operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Actions to find occur throughout an operation. In some combat situations, it may be enough to discover the location, motivation, organisation and strength of an enemy. In more complex situations, it is important to have contextual understanding of the situation, to understand the physical and cultural aspects of the environment, and to understand the likely consequences of activity on the enemy – for example on their morale – and perhaps on a population.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fix is explained in paragraph 8-46, under the shaping action of the operational framework. fixing involves denying an enemy their goals, distracting them and depriving them of freedom of action. Note that fixing can be achieved using a range of tactical methods, for example through the use of direct or indirect firepower, jamming, deception, saturation patrolling, overt surveillance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Strike is a form of decisive engagement, as described in the operational framework. To strike is to manoeuvre and then take direct action to achieve the purpose of the mission.
a. As explained in paragraph 8-15-8-18, manoeuvre means more than movement in combination with fire. It allows commanders to marshal their capabilities so that they are focused for greatest effect, avoiding enemy strengths and exploiting their weaknesses. effective manoeuvre exploits an enemy’s weaknesses before they can protect them, presenting multiple threats to which they are unable to respond coherently.
b. Direct action in combat usually means seizing objectives or destroying enemy forces. In a broader sense, direct action incorporates any decisive action that is focused on undermining an opponent’s will, cohesion, understanding or capability. It is generally preferable to apply concentrated violence to win quickly at minimum cost. However, a more protracted approach may be necessary. Then, actions are sequenced and sustained so that the effects are cumulative.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Exploit is to seize opportunity created by previous activity in order to achieve an objective, or directly to fulfil part of a commander’s intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The way in which operations in the land environment relate to each other can also be described geographically, in terms of a deep, close and rear framework. In this framework, deep and rear operations are defined in relation to the close battlespace of operations in and around the main forces of a formation. Geography in the land environment is important as it describes where intended operations take place and because so often the terrain, and who controls it, is vital or at least key. even in a non-linear battlespace, the concepts of deep, close and rear, and a sense of range and proximity, aid understanding. When used in combination with the operational and tactical frameworks, they provide a powerful method in helping to visualise, organise and integrate activity. Any or all of the activities described by the tactical functions can be applied anywhere in the geographic framework.
a. Deep operations are conducted at long range and often over a protracted timescale, against an adversary’s forces or resources not currently engaged in the close battle. They may comprise intelligence gathering or fires, manoeuvre and information activities, targeting key vulnerabilities (the will, cohesion or capabilities of an adversary). Deep operations are usually conducted at the corps or divisional level, often supported by other components. Deep operations conducted by land forces are distinguished by their sustainment and communication requirements, and also by their significant potential to dislocate an adversary, if conducted at speed and with sufficient force.
b. Close operations are those conducted by the main body of a formation, often in direct contact with an adversary or situation. They are usually conducted at short range and in an immediate timescale. The means include, for example, destruction, arrest, deception, direct fire and rapid manoeuvre.
c. rear operations establish and maintain friendly forces in order to generate freedom of action for deep and close operations. They include many administrative and logistic activities, protection of critical assets and infrastructure and real estate management. They may require stability activities to maintain or gain consent of a host nation and also the range of offensive and defensive activities through combined arms manoeuvre.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are four groups of tactical activities: offensive, defensive, stability and enabling. each activity is intended to create or contribute to a particular effect on the understanding, physical capability, and/or will and cohesion of other actors. Competence in planning and executing the tactical activities is fundamental to a land force’s fighting Power. These tactical activities frequently occur simultaneously within a single area of operations, in accordance with idea of the mosaic of conflict. In operational design and tactics, the groups of tactical activities are closely related. Defensive and stability activities often follow offensive activities, as a force prepares to respond to an enemy counter-attack, and the force becomes responsible for the security of a captured town, for example. A classic aspect of tactics is to decide where and to what degree to concentrate force in an offensive activity and where and how much to enable that by economy of effort elsewhere – often in a defensive activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The purpose of offensive activities is to defeat enemies, in accordance with the Manoeuvrist Approach. Offensive activities include pre-emption to gain the initiative, disruption of an adversary’s offensive action, deception or diversion, seizing ground and fixing. In offensive activities, the attacker seeks to create the conditions for freedom of movement and manoeuvre; confuse the enemy’s understanding; break or reduce their cohesion and will, or defeat their forces selectively. Offensive activities are conducted as part of most types of operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The main characteristics of offensive activities are surprise and shock; the seizure and retention of the initiative; agility, by which fleeting opportunities are taken; and superior tempo, through which the intensity and sequence of activities is maintained to keep the adversary off balance. In offensive activities, the real damage to the enemy’s will is caused by surprise and shock. Inflicting physical damage is only one way of doing so. The effects of firepower, tempo, simultaneity and in particular surprise should be exploited by operating throughout the depth of an area. Manoeuvre in the enemy’s depth poses a threat, to which they are obliged to respond. It will not, however, always be possible to out-manoeuvre the enemy. Considerable force may have to be applied, either directly or indirectly, to neutralise or dislodge them if they cannot be by-passed. even in operations that involve a lot of manoeuvre, it is highly likely that some force elements will be required to destroy enemy forces or seize defended terrain. Commanders seek to create surprise and shock, to achieve a break-in to an opponent’s defences, followed by aggressive exploitation within and beyond them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are nine offensive activities, each with a specific purpose:
a. Attack. An attack is an offensive action against a specified objective.
(1) Deliberate attacks mass combat power at the expense of time.
(2) hasty attacks trade time and detailed preparation for speed, to seize fleeting opportunities.
(3) Counter-attacks and spoiling attacks seek to defeat or disrupt an enemy force made vulnerable by its own offensive action. Spoiling attacks have the more limited aim of disruption. An attack may require a significant local advantage in combat power to succeed. A rule of thumb is a 3:1 advantage, but this usually adjusted based on other factors such as the state of the enemy; the type of combat power available to the attacking force, including supporting fires; the degree of surprise achieved; and the extent to which the cohesion of the enemy force is successfully shattered. The result of these factors may be a need for only a 1:1 ratio, possibly less. But there are times when the enemy is resolute and there is little scope for manoeuvre, so very significant firepower and/or force ratios of even 5:1 are required, and example would be the break in to a well- prepared position.
b. raid. A raid is launched as a swift penetration of hostile territory to secure information, confuse the adversary, seize a high-value individual or target, or to destroy physical positions. Raids end with a planned withdrawal upon completion of the assigned mission.
c. exploitation. exploitation usually follows a successful attack and is designed to disorganise the enemy in depth. As a tactical activity, it is characterised by a rapid advance against lessening resistance. The purpose is both physical and psychological. Physically, the aim is to retain the initiative by preventing opponents from reorganising their defence or conducting an orderly withdrawal. The psychological effect of exploitation is to create confusion and apprehension throughout the enemy force, reducing its capacity to react. This may be decisive in itself.
d. Pursuit. The role of a pursuit is to catch or cut off a hostile force attempting to escape or absconding individuals, with the aim of defeating or perhaps destroying them. It develops from a successful exploitation and starts when the target is demoralised and beginning to disintegrate under pressure. A pursuit may target enemy forces seeking to escape from their own initiated ambush. In this case, rapidly following up into their depth to cut off their extraction would be vital.
e. Feint. The purpose of a feint is to distract an enemy force by seeking combat or contact with it.
f. Demonstration. The role of a demonstration is to distract an enemy’s attention without seeking contact. Both feints and demonstrations can contribute to fixing, and can be designed to have psychological as well as physical effects.
g. reconnaissance in force. Reconnaissance in force is used to induce an enemy to disclose the location, size, strength, disposition or the intention of their force by making them respond to offensive activity.
h. Ambush. The purpose of an ambush is to inflict damage on the enemy while denying them an opportunity to counter-attack, principally through surprise, in an action concentrated in space and time.
i. Breakout of encircled forces. A breakout leads to an encircled force taking offensive action to link up with a main force. The breakout attempts to surprise the encircling enemy, so there is considerable advantage in attempting to breakout at the earliest opportunity, before the encirclement solidifies.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The purpose of defensive activities is to defeat or deter a threat. They are generally intended to protect the force and to provide the right conditions for offensive activities. Defensive activities alone are not usually decisive without a subsequent offensive activity, but they can be strategically decisive, for example by creating the secure conditions required to defeat an insurgency. Like offensive activities, defensive activities apply to combat and all types of operations. Defensive activities are not synonymous with weakness or defeat. Whilst offensive action is an important Principle of War, it is just as important to be able to conduct defensive activities well.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defensive activities may be necessary in some operations or at certain stages in a campaign, for example, to buy time, or to generate or maintain opportunities for offensive activities. By holding key terrain or fixing the enemy in one area, the conditions for offensive activities in another can be created. The object is to force an enemy into an action that narrows its options, reduces its fighting Power and fixes it for a counter-attack. The challenge is to seize the initiative from the attacker. While maintaining the integrity and cohesion of the force, the defenders seek to hold off the attack. They lure the attackers into situations where the defenders can create and exploit surprise, denying the attackers information, both passively and actively, for example, by attacking their command systems. Through this range of activities, defenders can fix their enemy for subsequent defeat by counter-attack.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The three principal types of defensive activity are mobile or area defence, with combinations of both, and delay.
a. Mobile defence. Mobile defence is used to defeat an attack by focusing on the adversary’s forces, rather than seeking to hold ground. Mobile defence combines a fixing element that denies the enemy freedom of manoeuvre, and an element to counter-attack. The balance between these two forces depends upon the mission and relative capabilities. The force ratios required are similar to those needed for an attack, and depend on the situation. The counter-attack element of mobile defence requires forces that can defeat the enemy and are mobile in the terrain.
b. Area defence. Area defence is used to defeat an attack by denial of ground through the concentration of forces and counter-mobility effects, for example, using obstacles or field defences. The most effective area defences operate in combination with screening, delaying, blocking actions and counter-attacks, some of which require mobile defence to weaken the attackers by inflicting losses, canalising and slowing them down before they arrive at the area defence. Because this form of defence involves prepared field defences, it can usually be conducted at a numerical disadvantage to the enemy. A rule of thumb is that a well-prepared defence can defeat or block an enemy with a 3:1 advantage.
c. Delay. Delaying activities are those in which a force being pressed by an attacking adversary trades space for time, reducing the adversary’s momentum and inflicting damage without itself becoming decisively committed. Delay is conducted to slow an enemy force’s advance, interdicting movement and gathering information about its intentions, without giving information away. Delaying activities also allow the commander to prepare for a counter-attack. These actions require a particularly high standard of collective performance in manoeuvre and command and control. A delay can only be conducted by the most mobile forces for the terrain. It is usually conducted with as much economy of effort as possible, except where ground is to be held for any length of time.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Stability activities are bespoke tactical methods used for delivering the stabilisation aspect of any land operation. They require a full spectrum approach with host nation and allied agencies. Those tasks that involve close cooperation with other agencies, and particularly host nation agencies and forces, require individuals with the right skills and personalities. These are broadly the same as the five aspects of human interoperability (language, rapport, respect, knowledge and patience). There are four types of stability activities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Security and control. Security is a fundamental human need and is most likely to motivate and regulate behaviour. Security (human, personal, national and physical) creates the conditions in which other activity crucial to well-being can take place. People will generally give their loyalty to the group that best meets this need. Winning the contest for security is therefore essential to establishing the security of a state. Security and control activities include providing reassurance patrols, public order and population control, incident response, and protection of key sites. These activities require a lot of manpower.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Support to security sector reform. Support to security sector reform is one element of capacity building, focused on developing security capacity. Stabilising a state depends on transferring responsibility for providing security to indigenous, host nation forces. This requires a full spectrum approach to reform the security sector itself, for example by removing those who contribute to insecurity and fear, although care should be taken not to undermine the fragile security architecture that may exist. Military forces can contribute to this approach by training, advising, assisting and accompanying host nation security forces. Being able to deploy early to prevent or mitigate conflict is important and may make a larger operation less necessary. Although it is not strictly a military task, building indigenous police force capacity may also fall to land forces, so long as it does not handicap the development of the state’s military forces, if they are required first.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Support to initial restoration of essential services. Sustainable security depends on providing essential services, for example, medical services, electricity, water, sewerage and food. The more demanding the physical environment and the more destructive the preceding fighting, the greater the lack of services will be felt. The solutions are in the hands of the civilian components of a full spectrum approach. If the security situation is not permissive to civilian specialists, military forces need to be able to improve delivery of these services in the short-term, because they are often the outward and actual signs of a better life. It is also likely to be a framework security task to protect the key nodes and distribution points from disruption. A lack of essential services will be exploited by adversaries and will create discomfort, tension and disorder.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Support to interim governance tasks. Although the development of national and local legislatures, executives and courts, a constitutional and legal system and other aspects of a functioning government is not core military business, military forces will need to understand and to some extent be involved in these institutions. At the very least, they will require protection. The expertise is found elsewhere so the quicker developing capacity in governance becomes a civil lead, the better. Military activity in governance, for example support to elections, requires large numbers as well as suitable individuals. Beyond the establishment of essential services, which are linked closely to security, is the development of a state’s economy and infrastructure. These are strategic and generational projects, but the degree of early progress will have a direct effect on the success of the campaign. While there is some relevant military expertise, for example in civil engineering, military forces are only likely to be capable of tactical levels of support, although this could have strategic effect. The military priority is to create the security required for trade, poverty reduction, infrastructure development and enterprise to take place.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Enabling activities link other tactical activities together. They include those intended to make or break contact with an enemy, and those conducted out of contact. As with offensive and defensive activities, their applicability across all types of operations is to be understood. Successful execution requires the same level of planning and training as that required for offensive, defensive or stability activities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Reconnaissance. Reconnaissance activities are missions to obtain, by observation and detection, information about, and understanding of, the human, information and physical aspects of the land operating environment. Ground reconnaissance can be mobile (scouting) or static (for example, surveillance by using observation posts) and is conducted in conjunction with reconnaissance from the air, space and cyberspace.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Security. Security activities provide early and accurate warning of hostile actions in order to protect the force. The two specific security tasks are to screen (cover a force) or to guard (a screen with the addition of fires or offensive action).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Advance to contact. The advance to contact seeks to gain or regain contact with an enemy under the most favourable conditions. It is normally executed in preparation for subsequent offensive activity and therefore ends when a force is positioned for the attack.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Meeting engagement. A meeting engagement involves action between two moving forces. The meeting may be intentional or unintentional on either side. The general conditions for meeting engagement are that neither force is prepared for defence; both are generally moving; and there is an element of surprise on both sides. Commanders think through the possibilities and the need to gain the initiative as rapidly as possible, by fixing their enemy and manoeuvring assertively. In a meeting engagement in particular, commanders with the most effective decision-action cycle will prevail.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Link-up. The aim of a link-up is to join two or more units or formations. Link-up activities normally occur in contested territory and may involve different types of forces. A typical example is a link-up between ground and air manoeuvre forces in which the former relieves the latter in place.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Relief of troops. The relief of troops occurs when one force takes over actions or activities from another. There are four types of relief action. The first is the relief in place in which all or part of a force is replaced in an operating area by an incoming unit. This can be a theatre level, operational level, or a tactical level action, for example, to and from a forward operating base. The second is the relief of encircled forces, in which a force’s freedom of action and security of re-supply is restored in order for it to regain the initiative before the adversary is able to deliver a decisive action. The third is the forward passage of lines, in which one force moves through another, for example holding a bridgehead, or attacks through a unit in contact with the enemy. The fourth type of relief operation is the rearward passage of lines, in which a force moving from contact passes through another unit in defence. In all reliefs of troops, the in-place force is required to prepare for, brief and accommodate the needs of the relieving force to maintain continuity and sustain effect. These are complicated enabling actions which require very effective planning, control and integration of capabilities, particularly between the land and air environments.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Withdrawal. A withdrawal occurs when a commander seeks to disengage the force from physical contact with an enemy, for example to transition to another action. Contact may be maintained through means such as indirect fire, reconnaissance or surveillance. The withdrawal is conducted so as to minimise interference by the enemy and to preserve fighting Power. It is critical that the ability to move rapidly to offensive or defensive actions is retained. Withdrawal is also used to change conditions on the ground or to allow a reinvestment of fighting Power in a different way. Operational withdrawal may be implemented to change the dynamic in a stabilisation context, for example by changing perceptions of occupation, or to allow indigenous capability its independence during a transition period.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Retirement. A retirement is a movement by a force away from and out of contact with an enemy. Such a force may require protection, for example a screen or guard, and be wary of being interdicted by an adversary’s deep missions; or surprised by the actions of a population.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
March. A march is conducted to move a force efficiently to its place of tactical employment. Units prepare to come into contact with the enemy, but do not expect to do so. The march is distinct from tactical movement, in which units move in battle formations and are either in contact with or expect to meet an enemy. When planned and conducted efficiently, a march adds tempo to operations. A march, and the relief of troops, requires regulation when conducted at formation level; this is often conducted by reconnaissance troops, because of their mobility and aptitude for communications.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Obstacle breaching. The breaching and crossing of obstacles, for example, minefields, improvised explosive devices and rivers, normally occur during offensive activities, but may also be necessary during enabling and defensive activities. These enabling activities can occur throughout the operating area and will often involve a passage of lines. They are complicated and require extensive planning, rehearsal, and specialist capabilities because they have a significant impact on the tempo, manoeuvrability and the security of the force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Basics of Understanding.
a. Data is the lowest level, comprising raw signals detected by a sensor or collector.
b. information is data that has been processed to provide further meaning; it forms the basis of the common operating picture.
c. Knowledge is information analysed to provide meaning and value and is derived from both internal and external sources. Internal sources comprise formal education, historical precedent and practical experience. external sources contain both regulated information, collected by ISR assets and processed into military intelligence, and unregulated information such as from the media. These sources form the basis of situational awareness.
d. Understanding comes from applying judgement to knowledge to gain a deeper level of awareness of a situation’s inner relationships and implications for the future. Judgement is a purely human skill, based upon experience, expertise, and intuition. Understanding, therefore, concerns the acquisition, development and application of knowledge to prioritise information requirements, make sense of a given context, make better decisions, adapt and influence behaviours.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding falls into three types. individual understanding is the personal interpretation of knowledge. Collective understanding is the shared perspective held by members of distinct groups that have their own ethos, creed and identity. Common understanding is the ability to comprehend perceptions of groups other than our own and to establish a common baseline for communication, interpretation and action. Common understanding, therefore, is key to establishing the interoperability required between arms, Services, nations and agencies when working to a common goal. It is also fundamental to planning and executing operations whose outcomes are changing or maintaining the behaviours of a range of actors.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding has four connected characteristics. first, since understanding is the application of knowledge to make sense of a given context, it is inherently contextual. Second, the context evolves over time and so understanding is perishable and must be constantly refreshed to remain valid. Third, understanding is imperfect. Important, early moves in an operation take place when understanding is low, and when adversaries are likely to understand the physical and human environments better than our own forces do. Commanders need to take the initiative and be willing to act early, taking considered risks based on incomplete understanding and rigorous assumptions. finally, understanding is competitive. The ability of land forces to hold the initiative will depend on how rapidly they gain and maintain understanding and adjust to the environment relative to their adversaries. The race for understanding requires an organisational culture that places a premium on continual learning; and well- established processes to gather lessons quickly from a theatre of operations, informing concurrent force generation and the appropriate adaptation of plans and structures.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The degree to which understanding is inherently imperfect is relative to the impact of a number of common threats, which must be recognised and mitigated. As understanding is perishable, it must be dynamic to be effective. It is subjective and so susceptible to a range of psychological factors. It is also entirely dependent on the accuracy and relevance of the data, information and knowledge from which it is drawn. In adversarial situations, understanding is subject to deception that purposefully aims to manipulate the data and information presented. The final two factors rest on a paradox of understanding, namely that there seems to be never enough information and yet simultaneously there is often too much information from which to glean the key elements necessary for effective understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In the context of the characteristics of and threats to understanding, there are six principles of understanding.
a. Sub-conscious knowledge may be so ingrained that it is difficult for us to both recognise and assess it without sufficient attention to self-awareness. Also, our background and psychological disposition may mean that we are liable to bias or complacency.
b. Critical analysis is the intellectual discipline that applies deliberate introspective judgement to interpret, analyse and evaluate a problem and explain the context upon which that judgement is based.
c. Creative thinking examines problems or situations from an original or unorthodox perspective. Background, training and experience can often create conditional thinking prejudicial to critical analysis. Creative thinking should be encouraged to examine a situation from a fresh perspective and to create imaginative and competing hypotheses.
d. In areas where change is slow, or the requirement is enduring, developing and maintaining understanding requires continuity in observation and expertise. A balance must, however, be struck between the imperative for continuity and the risk of gradual assimilation. fresh perspectives should be encouraged, exposing and offering alternative points of view.
e. Military operations are usually inter-agency, multinational and joint and so depend on collaboration between all actors for success. The ‘need to know’ principle endures, but a collaborative environment relies on information sharing – the ‘need to share’. This helps develop common understanding and trust.
f. Fusion is the blending of intelligence and/or information from multiple sources or agencies into a coherent picture. It requires common procedures between the actors and agencies involved and is essential when developing a coherent, common operating picture. It relies on effective interoperability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders set the climate in which understanding is enabled. If commanders are to make the right decisions, they must create a climate that encourages open- mindedness, critical analysis and creative thinking. They must also clearly articulate their requirements for understanding and enable their staff to work effectively.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Culture and beliefs influence how people, including ourselves, behave and why they engage in conflict. Many aspects of human behaviour are the same everywhere, but culture plays a very important role in shaping how people perceive situations and their understanding. Contemporary operations are both multinational and conducted among people who are likely to be from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds to us; understanding of culture is therefore non-discretionary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As illustrated in figure 8A-1, understanding is drawn from a broad and deep pool of information and even wider basis of data. Without effective information management, establishing individual or collective understanding is difficult. The volume of information and the speed and means of its communication are ever-increasing and if unmanaged, risk creating anarchy. Information management and exploitation aim to provide the right information to the right people at the right time. It is a function of command to ensure that these processes are sufficiently resourced and applied across a land force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding, based on data and supported by information technology, is a human activity and so subject to psychological factors. At an individual level, intelligence, personality, emotional state, experience, learning, motivation, status and role, and physical condition all affect how people think and, thus, understand situations. In group contexts, understanding, perceptions and attitudes are developed through the accumulated thinking of individuals interacting with each other. It is important to guard against a number of adverse factors. Peer pressure can be positive in terms of team building and discipline, but can also inhibit creative thinking and innovation through generating ‘groupthink’. Overcoming groupthink requires acceptance of authentic dissent; commanders should be aware of this and both encourage and acknowledge dissenting views. Other factors include unconscious bias and social prejudice, which are particularly damaging in an operational context where cultural and social sensitivities and understanding are paramount. These factors cannot be eradicated, but through recognising them, conscious application of the principles of understanding and a positive command climate, they may become less prevalent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Adherence to analysis and decision-making tools that are shared across a combined arms, joint and multinational force significantly aids individual, collective and common understanding. Analytical frameworks assist in bringing the full range of relevant factors about a given situation into consideration. PMESII (political, military, economic, social, infrastructure and information) is one such framework, widely used by NATO and the United States. It is also common to analyse actors’ centres of gravity, and their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A centre of gravity is defined in NATO as: the characteristics, capabilities or localities from which a nation, an alliance, a military force or other grouping derives its freedom of action, physical strength or will to fight. The purpose of a centre of gravity analysis is to identify actor vulnerabilities that can either be attacked or threatened, or be protected or strengthened. Designed for strategic and operational- level analysis, it is also a useful tool for land forces at the tactical level.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The centre of gravity can be deduced from analysis of what actors need to achieve their aim. It describes the primary element of their power in relation to a particular situation. At the tactical level, a centre of gravity of military actors, friendly or enemy, is usually the principal physical element of their force. By dint of being the centre of gravity, its defeat leads to that of the force as a whole. While a centre of gravity is relatively enduring, it is not fixed; understanding must be continuously refreshed to test whether the original assessment remains valid.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commonly expressed as a verb, critical capabilities describe what a centre of gravity can do that makes it so powerful. for example, a particular armoured formation may form the tactical centre of gravity of a force, which could be our own, an enemy’s or a partner’s whose capacity we are building. Its critical capabilities, in this example, may be that it can manoeuvre and strike in depth.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Critical requirements are the resources or means which are essential to the realisation of critical capabilities. Usually described as a noun, following the example above, they could include specific weather conditions, avenues of approach, or the armoured formation’s morale, fires, combat service support or combat engineer forces. In a capacity building context, critical requirements could also include the allocation of appropriate personnel or training resources.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Critical vulnerabilities are those critical requirements, or components of them, that are deficient, or vulnerable to neutralisation or defeat in a way that will contribute to a centre of gravity failing to achieve its critical capability. Continuing the example in a combat context, we cannot affect the weather and critical combat service support force elements may be very well protected. The combat engineer forces, however, may be particularly vulnerable and if they are dislocated, disrupted or destroyed, the force will lose the critical manoeuvre support essential to achieving its objectives. In combat, an indirect approach seeks not to target the centre of gravity directly, rather to apply strength against critical vulnerabilities. In protecting our own force and in developing the capacity of another force, the same principle applies, except that we apply strength to protect what might otherwise be vulnerabilities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Warfighting. In warfighting (also referred to as major combat operations), most of the activity is directed against a significant form of armed aggression perpetrated by large-scale military forces belonging to one or more states or to a well-organised and resourced non-state actor. These forces engage in combat operations in a series of battles and engagements at high intensity, varying in frequency and scale of forces involved. The immediate goal is to ensure freedom of action at the expense of their opponents. The rhythm of operations is often high with high logistics consumption. enemy armed forces may also use irregular forces and CBRN capabilities to support conventional forces’ military objectives. Operating in a context where warfighting is the predominant theme may be further exacerbated, perpetuated or exploited by other irregular actors seeking to benefit from instability, whether through insurgency, terrorism, criminality or disorder.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Security. The transition from combat operations to multi-agency stability operations (to re-establish stability and prosperity, underpinned by the rule of law) is important to establish a perception of security. It is likely to be characterised not by the attainment of specific end states (such as absolute victory) but by incremental conditions-based outcomes (albeit they may reflect political direction to achieve particular goals according to a rough timetable). The mix of actors, and their respective motivations, will be highly dynamic. Conventional opponents, even once defeated, may re-appear as, or be reinforced by, irregular forces; the threat they pose may need to be countered at the same time as re-establishing legitimate indigenous governance and authority. Pursuing the gradual transition towards stability, land forces are likely to support the activities of other actors in protecting, strengthening and restoring civil society, governance, rule of law and the economy. Operating in a context where security is the predominant theme requires an increasing number of stability activities together with offensive and defensive activities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Peace support. The peace support theme describes an operating environment following an agreement or ceasefire that has established a permissive environment where the level of consent and compliance is high, and the threat of disruption is low. Where peace support is the predominant theme, land forces may expect to develop almost exclusively stability activities, even if ready for offensive and defensive activities. The purpose is to sustain a situation that has already met the criteria established by international mandate; the use of force by peacekeepers is normally limited to self-defence. Typical peace support activities include peacemaking, peace enforcement, peacekeeping, peace building. Peace support activities are most often mandated and coordinated by the United Nations, but may be delegated to a military alliance such as NATO.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence engagement. Defence engagement is the means by which the UK employs Defence assets and activities to achieve influence without the use or threat of force. It includes state to state military dialogue, bilateral or multinational training and exercises, and support to host nation security structures. Defence engagement spans the mosaic of conflict and types of operation; it is most effective when initiated as peacetime military engagement, continuing if necessary through conflict and into post- conflict stability operations. Its purpose is to sustain the UK’s position and influence, protect and promote prosperity and security, build capacity and will and establish comprehensive relationships and understanding. early, effective and enduring defence engagement within a full spectrum approach can help to avert instability and, if not, reduce the likelihood of it being prolonged. It is a necessary theme of all operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The types of operation reflect the breadth of utility and application of land forces as part of a full spectrum approach. Throughout, the primary purpose of land forces is to conduct combat operations – to apply or threaten to apply force. This capability provides more than the potential to defeat enemies, protecting the people of the UK and our way of life. It gives credibility in security, peace support and peacetime military engagement. It thus underpins land forces’ contribution to the projection of influence and promotion of prosperity. However, while combat is land forces’ first duty, it is not sufficient. To be effective across all operations themes and types of operation, it requires professional understanding, study, training and equipping for the full range of likely tasks, whether combat or stability focused.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Projection. By dint of being an island nation with global responsibilities and ambitions, projection of land forces is central to all types of operation overseas. Interventions will be launched to deter and reassure, to prevent a crisis from escalating or from spreading, to contain a threat, to reinforce a fragile peace, secure an objective or to protect a vital interest overseas. Land forces will be delivered from the sea, through the air or across the land. In the latter case, land forces manoeuvre from a secure port of entry at speed and range to gain a position of advantage. Projection requires capable military forces at varying levels of readiness, sustainable at range and imbued with an expeditionary mind-set, individually and collectively.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Combat is a fight or struggle between armed groups. It is, by definition, adversarial and physically and mentally demanding. Combat is ultimately what armies are for. Combat involves a combination of friction, uncertainty, chaos, violence, danger and stress. It always has degrees of asymmetry. The aim of combat is primarily to defeat an enemy force, either by closing with it or from a distance, or to secure an objective by force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In combat, operations take place in a situation usually characterised as war, in which fighting, damage, coercion and persuasion are frequent, widespread, intense and conducted by formed groupings, units or formations. Combat is necessary when interests are directly threatened. Combat is a demanding purpose because of its high tempo; the complexity of all arms, all-environment integration; the high degrees of manoeuvre, firepower and protection required; the level of risk; and the potential for destruction and loss. Combat is characterised by battles, probably at several levels of command, requiring complex control methods, sophisticated exploitation of information and situational awareness. There will be significant rates of physical activity and material consumption. Combat demands advanced levels of collective training and performance. Despite its demands, it can never be discounted or wished away: the British Army must be capable of this most demanding of roles.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Combat on a significant scale is sometimes regarded as ‘conventional’ or ‘industrial’ warfighting between uniformed, state forces in a space conveniently absent of people. This characterisation is simplistic. Instead, the threats faced are ‘hybrid’, blending conventional and unconventional forms of conflict, using attributable and non-attributable methods. Some areas of the battlespace are free of clutter and congestion, while others are not. Combat has always included ‘hybrid’ threats and asymmetric frictions, including the significance of populations, although during the Cold War, conventional military approaches did not give them sufficient attention. This does not mean that they were not there.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Combat cannot be considered in isolation from the other types of operation. It is vital, when preparing for combat, to consider how it might impact on other, perhaps subsequent, activities. It is also important that the build-up to combat does not gain unstoppable momentum. Conflict prevention, for example, through deterrence, is usually preferable to the consequences of committing to battle. However, a force will only deter if it is militarily credible and this means being capable of combat. Combat occurs, or is liable to occur, in most of the operations described below. It is the intensity of the combat that varies. Intensity can be measured in terms of scale (size and numbers), longevity, rates of consumption and degrees of violence and damage.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Connected to the security, peace support and defence engagement operations themes, but not exclusively, are stability operations. This broad categorisation does not imply separation in time or space from combat operations. They may be conducted prior to, after or during combat, but will rarely be conducted in isolation. for example, counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism and counter-criminality operations will most likely complement each other, alongside capacity building and other stability operations. While the military instrument may lead in combat operations, albeit within a full spectrum approach, in stability operations the military instrument is in support.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
This distinction is reflected in the principles of stability operations. These apply to all land stability operations, the balance of emphasis reflecting the nature of the specific task. In all cases, primacy of political purpose is the foremost consideration.
Principles of stability operations
• Primacy of political purpose. All military operations have a political purpose, but in stability operations political issues are usually highly relevant to tactical actions. This principle informs all the other principles and dictates the desired outcome, planning and conduct of the campaign. Military actions must always be subordinate to and aligned with the overall inter-agency, politically-led campaign. The political authority, which may be a United Nations Special Representative to the Security General, another international appointee or the host nation government, will usually have overall responsibility for military operations. Depending on the operation, lower level representatives of the authority may play an important role in operations, even to the point of authorising military action.
• Unity of effort. All agencies, military and civilian, international and host nation must co-operate for the campaign to be effective. This means that within the security line of operations, the activities of the components and other actors, particularly those with intelligence and security responsibilities, should be coordinated down to at least unit level. Also, military and civilian agencies must co-operate. Coterminous military, police and government boundaries, with co-operation committees at each level of authority, are a commonly used framework to achieve unity of effort.
• Understand the context. To ensure that the military campaign, operations and tactical actions are consistent with the political purpose, it is necessary to understand the historical, regional and political context of the problem. Without an adequate understanding of the human terrain, land forces will be unable to influence effectively the relevant audiences, actors, adversaries and enemies. Understanding, and the intelligence networks and cultural expertise that underpin it, has to be built over time, and involves significant cooperation with other agencies.
• Foster host nation governance and capacity. At every opportunity the force must help to develop the host nation’s ability to govern effectively. In the security sector this is likely to include the capability needed to conduct effective and appropriate security and stability operations in accordance with the other principles.
• Prepare for the long term. The campaign must aim for the long term under legitimate authority (the host nation). The intervening force is likely to be present for only a short time in large numbers, so its actions must be aimed at creating a foundation on which successor international and host nation authorities and forces can build.
• Provide security for the population. The first duty of any government is to provide security for the population. It is a task in which security forces play a major role as insecurity will usually be the main reason there is a stability operation at all. The security operation will have two aims: making the population safe from the effects of conflict (including from our own actions); and denying violent actors (such as insurgents) access to the population. Security includes human security (security as in safety stability, but also access to essential services, for example, food, health, education and justice. Armed forces are not usually responsible for the other aspects of human security, and must therefore cooperate with those who are. It is essential to challenge and ideally deny adversaries access to the population, so that it is more difficult for them to influence the population and to get support such as money, manpower, intelligence and food.
• neutralise adversaries. The neutralisation of armed adversaries and their supporters can occur in a number of ways including deterrence, defeat, dispersal, disarmament or absorption into legitimate security forces, political movements and society. Armed forces play a significant role in neutralising adversaries. Depending on the circumstances this can include combined arms manoeuvre operations, raids, patrols, searches, precision attacks and a lead contribution to demobilisation, disarmament, and reintegration (DDR) efforts. To be effective and to avoid undermining the security of the population, the military contribution to the neutralisation of adversaries requires accurate, actionable intelligence.
• gain and maintain popular support. In stability operations, the state, its security forces and intervening external armed forces are in competition with adversaries for the support of the people. The side that succeeds in gaining the support of the people, and denies that support to the other side, is likely to win in the long term. Gaining and maintaining support depends in part on providing security, but it also depends significantly on the day-to-day conduct of the authorities and their impact on people’s daily lives.
• Anticipate, learn and adapt. The effective force improves all aspects of its performance throughout the campaign. This requires formal systems to look for new ways of doing things, and learn lessons from effective and ineffective practice. The ideas and lessons must be disseminated to benefit the whole force, which requires the capacity to adjust doctrine, training, equipment and other aspects of capability.
• Operate in accordance with the law. The armed forces and the other agencies involved in stability operations must abide by the law and be seen to do so. This is more than a matter of the standing requirement to act lawfully. As the armed forces of a country which adheres strictly to the rule of law, our moral authority to intervene and conduct stability operations depends on our lawful conduct: it is about our integrity. This also applies to any alliance or coalition we are part of, and the host nation. It is a critical aspect of gaining and maintaining popular support, and of undermining any perceived legitimacy of adversaries. It is often the case that adversaries commit serious crimes and therefore our lawful conduct sets us apart. If members of the security forces are accused of breaking the law, legitimacy is maintained by visible and effective investigations and where necessary, prosecutions. In the end, cover-ups destroy legitimacy.

Counter-irregular activity. Counter-irregular activities fall into three categories: counter-insurgency, counter-terrorism and counter-criminality.
a. Counter-insurgency. Counter-insurgency (COIN) is defined as comprehensive civilian and military efforts made to defeat an insurgency and to address any core grievances. It encompasses those military, paramilitary, political, economic, psychological and civil actions taken by a government or its partners to defeat insurgency. The approach requires neutralisation of insurgents by killing, capturing, marginalising or reconciling them; controlling the level of violence and securing the population COIN is characterised by instances of combat, normally conducted at relatively low tactical levels. Consumption of resources and violence are low (relative to focused combat operations), but the nature of violence is likely to be more shocking because of its context, where normality is sought or actually appears to exist. for detailed land forces thematic doctrine the reader should consult the AfM series, within a context of broader understanding provided by joint and NATO doctrine.
b. Counter-terrorism. Counter-terrorism describes all preventive, defensive and offensive measures taken to reduce the vulnerability of forces, individuals and property against terrorist threats and/or acts, to respond to terrorist acts. Counter-terrorism operations may be conducted against state-sponsored, internal or transnational, autonomous armed groups who are not easily identified, and who may not fall under the categories of combatants defined in international law. Measures taken include those activities justified for the defence of individuals as well as containment measures implemented by military forces or civilian organisations. The latter are primarily conducted by police and special forces supported by conventional land forces. Land forces have a greater contribution to creating and maintaining effective protective measures to reduce the probability and impact of terrorist attacks against infrastructure or people.
c. Counter-criminality. Counter-criminality is the action focused on preventing organised criminal groups from escalating their activities to the point where they become a threat to allied forces. The character of conflict is such that insurgency, terrorism and criminality will often feed off each other. Land forces’ contribution to counter-criminality will be very much in support of specialist agencies, requiring deep contextual understanding to inform and assist these agencies as necessary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military contribution to peace support. Peace support activities impartially make use of diplomatic, civil and military means, normally in pursuit of United Nations Charter purposes and principles, to restore or maintain peace. Peace support cannot take place without some form of intervention having taken place first, which may be an uncontested deployment. Having intervened, land forces’ freedom to operate will be determined by the willingness of the opposing parties to seek resolution. Any reluctance may result in combat, either directly or in the protection of other agencies and the local population. The distinguishing factor of peace support operations is that land forces are neutral, supporting an international mandate rather than a host nation government necessarily. Peace support efforts include conflict prevention, peacemaking, peace enforcement, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. Defence engagement is intrinsic to all. This categorisation does not represent a sequential process where one necessarily leads to the next; for example, peacekeeping will not necessarily be preceded by peace enforcement. However, land forces must understand how the different types of efforts relate to, complement or overlap each other so that their actions support, rather than undermine, an on-going political process. figure 8C-1 provides a basic conceptual framework to visualise how these activities may relate to each other.
a. Conflict prevention. A range of activities, including defence engagement to keep inter and intra-state disputes from escalating into armed conflict.
b. Peacemaking. Conducted after the initiation of a conflict to secure a ceasefire or peaceful settlement involving primarily diplomatic action supported, when necessary, by direct or indirect use of military assets.
c. Peace enforcement. Designed to end hostilities through the application of a range of coercive measures, including the use of military force. It is likely to be conducted without the strategic consent of some, if not all, of the major conflicting parties.
d. Peacekeeping. Designed to assist the implementation of a ceasefire or peace settlement and to help lay the foundations for sustainable peace. It is conducted with the strategic consent of all major conflicting parties.
e. Peacebuilding. Designed to reduce the risk of relapsing into conflict by addressing the underlying causes of conflict and the longer-term needs of the people. It requires a commitment to a long-term process and may run concurrently with other types of peace support efforts.

Military contribution to humanitarian assistance. Humanitarian assistance is the use of available military resources to assist or complement the efforts of responsible civil actors in the operational area or specialised civil humanitarian organisations in fulfilling their primary responsibility to alleviate human suffering. They may occur in response to both natural and man-made disasters, and result from conflict or flight from political, religious or ethnic persecution. Military support to humanitarian assistance is limited in scope and duration. In a NATO context, it includes disaster relief, dislocated civilian support, security, technical support and CBRN management. for UK humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations, joint doctrine should be consulted.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military contribution to stabilisation and reconstruction. Stabilisation and reconstruction is normally a civilian-led process that commonly takes place during or after crisis in states that have lost the capacity to govern themselves effectively. As such it is best undertaken by those actors and organisations that have the relevant expertise, mandate and competences required. There may, however, be situations when the military is obliged to assume temporary responsibility until such time as the security situation allows for appropriate experts to assume the lead.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Capacity building. Capacity building can be a discrete type of stability operation, occurring across the mosaic of conflict, as well as a tactical function. As an operation, it may be conducted discretely or alongside other operations; it may form part of peacetime military engagement or in less benign circumstances, including in combat situations. Capacity building concerns those actions taken to improve military and, when necessary, civil and infrastructure capability. The military’s contribution is but one element of a broader integrated or full spectrum approach, which requires cooperation among all agencies engaged.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
evacuation. evacuation operations relocate specific actors to a place of safety and generally take place during crises.
a. non-combatant evacuation operations. Non-combatant evacuation operations (NEOs) are national diplomatic initiatives, but may see UK land forces supporting or supported by allies. NEOs are conducted to relocate (to a place of safety) non- combatants threatened in a foreign country.
b. extraction operations. extraction operations are those operations where a force conducts or assists in the withdrawal of military missions and units from a crisis region.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The security of the UK’s national territory itself is the primary concern of the UK Government and hence the priority for the use of military forces. The UK needs to be secured by operations at a distance because it is usually insufficient or too late to protect the state only at its borders. Land forces are to be prepared to contribute to home defence and to support the civil authorities when required. This is distinct from operations to protect UK territorial integrity, for example from invasion, although that would be the ultimate form of home defence. Military support to internal operations are described under the heading military aid to the civil authority or MACA. MACA includes the following.
a. Assistance may be provided by the Armed forces to other government departments for urgent work of national importance, responding to emergencies or in maintaining supplies and essential services. Also, UK Armed forces may be asked to provide assistance to communities for special projects or events of significant value, or through the attachment of volunteers.
b. Military support may be provided to civil law enforcement agencies, such as the police or Border force, in the maintenance of law, order and public safety using specialist capabilities or equipment beyond that of civil powers.
c. Training and logistic assistance may be provided to civil authorities, through the provision of the defence estate or facilities for either training or operational support to other agencies carrying out their duties. for example, allowing the police to use an army training centre to assemble and brief a large number of police officers, even though military personnel or equipment might not be involved.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Resilience, which is covered in detail by joint doctrine, is the overarching term used to describe activities and structures that ensure the UK Government can continue to function and deliver essential public services in time of national crisis, including terrorist attack and industrial action, or in civil crises such as floods. The British Army’s regional command structure, mass, technical skills, MACA activities, and secure real-estate and infrastructure are examples of capabilities that contribute significantly to national resilience.

The land force must have the capability to command complex and dynamic operations in the land environment, integrating the effects of joint, inter-agency and multinational partners to achieve the desired outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Command is the authority vested in an individual of the armed forces for the direction, co-ordination and control of military forces. It includes the processes by which commanders, supported by their staff, make decisions, convey intent, and impress their will in order to accomplish missions. Command is a blend of subjective art and objective science. It is founded on an understanding of the desired outcome; an appreciation of concepts, missions and priorities; and the allocation of resources. Its subjective elements include assessment of factors such as the impact of surprise, politics and morale; decision making where there is little or no information; and anticipating the enemy. It also requires objective analysis to control the operation and to resolve issues relating to the mechanics of movement, logistics, and communication and information systems (CIS). Control, as a function of command, is the oversight, direction and coordination of assigned forces in accordance with the commander’s plan and intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
This chapter describes the principles of command and the key characteristics of the human components of a successful command system – the commander and the staff. It then explains how command is exercised through standard command relationships and introduces the basic requirements for the control of operations. It concludes with an overview of the operations process, whereby commanders and their staff plan and execute operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Joint and NATO doctrine describe five principles of joint and multinational command.
a. Unity of command provides the necessary cohesion for planning and executing operations. Command relationships, by which commanders achieve this authority, must be determined when a force is established.
b. Continuity of command describes the ability for command authority to be exercised continuously over time in a given area of operations. It depends on appropriately trained, structured and resourced command support as well as on measures for deputising that are widely understood.
c. A chain of command describes the succession of commanders from a superior to a subordinate through whom command is exercised. It is a hierarchical structure that links points of command and defines their relationships. A clear chain of command, understood by all, strengthens integration between formations and units and enhances unity of effort. Subordinates must be in no doubt as to the command state within which they are operating, to whom they are responsible and for what. On multinational operations absolute clarity must be established over national responsibilities and those of the coalition or alliance.
d. The command structure should ensure that the capabilities of the force are integrated to achieve the commander’s objectives in the most effective way. The specific task organisation will reflect the higher commander’s requirements.
e. Mission Command, which is described in Chapter 6.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In addition to the overarching principles of joint and multinational command, the following considerations are relevant to the command of land operations:
a. There is a limit to the number of subordinates (and thus subordinate organisations) that a commander can effectively command in land operations while maintaining tempo and momentum; this is known as the span of command. This number will depend upon several factors including complexity of the task, geographical spread and nature of the organisation. The number of external organisations, including agencies, allies, coalition members and host nation force elements with which a commander has to interact are also considerations. The British Army’s experience suggests that for complex manoeuvre operations in contact with the enemy, a span of command should not exceed five subordinate manoeuvre groupings. This rule is not absolute but is a good principle for organising brigades, battlegroups and sub-units. fewer subordinate units or a smaller headquarters increases potential for tempo; but too few subordinates or too small a headquarters can reduce the momentum or meaningful outputs achievable.
b. Commanders and their headquarters must be flexible, energetic and agile. Headquarters are scalable by design so that they can configure themselves (possibly with augmentation) to adapt and undertake a number of different roles and tasks. The size and shape of the force under command, the range of actors with which the headquarters must interact, as well as the directed task will determine how a headquarters will be configured. A headquarters generates one or more command posts from which command is exercised.
c. Commanders of multinational land forces require political acumen, patience and tact. Their challenges include interoperability, the application of Mission Command, achieving unity of effort where unity of command does not exist, and fostering organisational agility. In addition, they need a detailed understanding of each national contingent’s strengths and weaknesses as well as their ethos, history and culture. Initially, consensus and cooperation may be based on little more than an agreement on the art of the possible.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The key human components of any command system are the commanders and their staff. While these are essential, they do not describe the entirety of a command system, which also requires a range of additional command support measures, including infrastructure, CIS and processes.
Commanders
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The role of commanders at any level is to make things happen: to make decisions on the actions of forces under command; to lead and control them; to judge and accept risk. Commanders must do so at a pace that contributes to the generation and maintenance of tempo relative to adversaries. It is also the role of commanders to create and foster an effective command climate. By the nature of their personality, leadership, command style and general behaviour, commanders have an enormous influence on the morale, sense of direction and performance of their staff, subordinate commanders and soldiers. Successful Mission Command depends on a climate of command which encourages subordinate commanders at all levels to think independently, to take the initiative and to be uninhibited in telling their superior accurate and unwelcome information. It is the commander’s responsibility to foster such a climate.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
To be effective, commanders require particular skills and qualities. There is no formula for the right combination, but deficiencies in any one compromise the ability of the commander to enforce their will. first, and of primary importance, are the functions of command; the ability to lead, decide and control. To perform these functions, commanders must understand the context and nature of the operation and direct their staff accordingly. In addition, they must have vision, intellect and initiative to simplify the complex and produce a battle-winning intent. However brilliant commanders’ powers of analysis and decision-making may be, they are of no use if they cannot express their intentions clearly to subordinates of all ranks. finally, commanders must have the ability to build relationships on many levels; both up and down the chain of command and with a range of joint, inter-agency, and multinational actors. Whilst robust leadership may be required, commanders must be empathetic and patient, prepared to collaborate and compromise through persuasion and negotiation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated Action and Mission Command focus commanders on seeking and exploiting opportunities, while anticipating and managing risk. Risks to the force and risks to the mission can be caused by adversaries, the environment and our own actions. It is a commander’s responsibility, supported by the staff, to judge and accept risks to the force or the mission, or both. This requires commanders to understand the evolving risk appetite of their higher commanders, their partners, and to ensure that their subordinates understand their own risk thresholds. This is fundamental to the successful application of Mission Command. Annex 9A explores risk in more detail.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders decide where they can best understand and influence events and outcomes. They identify the best position to observe, assess and lead in relation to their force, the means of command at their disposal and their mission. The enduring moral requirement to lead from the front will influence this decision, particularly at the tactical level. However, when positioned forward there is always a real risk of being distracted by the immediate dangers and losing the ability to command. The following factors, applicable to all levels of command, shape this decision.
a. the ability to assess the situation, including judging the condition and morale of the force and being able to impose will upon it.
b. Access to other actors, including those in the task force, key agencies and the host nation.
c. secure and reliable communications to the points of command.
d. Access to staff support for planning and decision-making to maintain continuity.
e. security, including physical and electronic protection and influencing decisions on the size and signature of a command post and its constituent parts.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The staff assists and support the commander in making and implementing decisions. It has no authority by itself, but derives authority from and exercises it in the name of the commander. All the activities of the staff are undertaken on behalf of a commander. Regardless of the level of command, the staff has three main roles:
a. The staff has the duty to support, advise and caution the commander. The staff supports by focusing on the two primary functions of control – coordinating and monitoring. Under the function of coordinating, the staff supports the commander by gathering, processing, analysing and presenting information in a manner that helps the commander to select a particular course of action. The staff is then responsible for planning, preparing and disseminating control measures, normally promulgated as orders. In the second and overlapping function of monitoring, the staff provides part of the feedback mechanism essential for subsequent timely decision-making. The staff needs to realise the commander’s intent and always strive to find opportunities to make it a reality. Nevertheless, the staff must not shy away from presenting considered, accurate, cautionary advice that may be unwelcome, but critical to success.
b. The staff also needs to support subordinate formations and units, whose ability to live, train and fight depends to a large extent on the actions of the staff of their superior headquarters. In the eyes of both superior and subordinate commanders and staff, the hallmark of a proficient headquarters is its staff’s capacity to work
in a timely, efficient and co-operative manner. Staff must not sit on information. It is the responsibility of the staff to ensure that all relevant information is passed to subordinate and flanking formations and units. The staff need to have a two-down mind-set; it is the staff’s responsibility at all levels to put subordinate forces into action to best advantage.
c. The third role of the staff is to inform the wider force, in particular higher, flanking, agency, allied and partner headquarters. This is essential to delivering unity of effort, mutual understanding and shared situational awareness.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The headquarters and its staff cells are organised so that the headquarters can conduct planning and execution appropriate to its level of command. functional expertise is harnessed and integrated to provide support across all the horizons required by the operation. This may, for example, see functional cells integrated into future plans, plans and operations cells. This integration is led by the chief of staff, who, as the principal staff officer in a headquarters, ensures that the commander’s intent is turned into workable plans, communicated to, and understood by, subordinate, superior and flanking formations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Many of the qualities required by commanders also apply to staff officers. This is particularly so for senior staff officers in national and multinational appointments. They may have considerable delegated powers of command or management authority and responsibility. In addition to the fundamental quality of leadership, shared by all officers, good staff officers must have loyal and trustworthy characters with independence of thought and judgement; the intellect to assess and communicate with accuracy and precision, and to understand the broader context in which they are operating; an appetite for hard work as well as team work; technical competence on associated CIS; and high levels of cultural awareness and political sensitivity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The effectiveness of the staff depends on human relationships. These include those between the commander and the staff, the staff and other levels of command, and amongst the staff themselves.
a. Although the opportunity for a close relationship with the commander will depend on the size and level of headquarters and the role of the staff officer, the fundamentals of the relationship between commander and staff endure. It should be characterised by a climate of loyalty, respect and individual initiative rather than one that is sycophantic and unquestioning; the independence of thought and timely action implicit in Mission Command is vital.
b. How the staff interact with subordinates, flanks and superior headquarters is critical. A staff should develop open and positive relationships with other staffs, based upon mutual respect and developed through a conscientious, determined and helpful approach to problem solving. Anything less will undermine confidence in the exercise of command at all levels.
c. The creation of an effective and closely knit staff team within the headquarters and between the headquarters and units is essential. There must be no secrets between branches and no avoidance of responsibilities. Team building is a command skill which requires effort and practice.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
states of command and control explain the relationships between land force organisations. States of command are concerned primarily with the ability to assign an independent mission, to reorganise a subordinate organisation to suit its task, or to direct specific tasks within an agreed mission. They exist to allow a higher headquarters to prioritise resources and effort, and to assist with task organisation when working with limited resources. When assigning states of command, commanders balance the need to maintain flexibility and generate tempo (which are best enabled by passing control to the lower level) while ensuring that they retain the ability to concentrate force and rapidly switch priorities (best achieved by commanding at a higher level). To establish the status of units under command, a commander seeks answers to the following four questions.
a. Can the commander use the unit for any purpose; in other words, give it a mission?
b. If a mission cannot be assigned, can the commander give the unit tasks within the given mission and so direct the mission’s execution?
c. Can the commander break up a unit into smaller groupings?
d. Are there any caveats on the use of units, for example employment limited to use for a specified duration?
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deputising command is not necessarily synonymous with appointing deputy commanders. There is a requirement for deputising when one or more of the following conditions apply: when there is a need to provide short term relief for the commander (for example, when resting or temporarily absent); when succession in the chain of command is necessary (for example, in the event that the original commander is killed or wounded in action, or relieved of command); or when there is a need to reduce the burden on a commander by delegating responsibilities.
a. In the absence of established deputy commanders, staff officers can provide reliefs for commanders for short periods. Lack of sleep can have a significant effect on the physical and cognitive performance of a commander. Attention lapses, reduced insight, leading to reduced understanding and an over-estimation of one’s own abilities are some of the common symptoms. Commanders have a duty to impose adequate sleep routines on themselves and on their subordinates.
b. Seconds-in-command provide succession at the lower tactical levels and are normally available to assume command at little or no notice if the original commander is no longer available to exercise command. At formation level, procedures for alternate command rest on nominating a subordinate commander to assume command.
c. Delegating command responsibilities allows the senior commander to concentrate on particular areas or concerns, leaving a nominated assistant or deputy to concentrate on others.
d. Deputy commanders of multinational forces are appointed in the main to help strengthen the collective command of an alliance or to bond coalition forces together, giving a visible expression of national stake and representation in the higher command. In these circumstances it is possible, although not ideal, to have more than one deputy commander, each of whom must have clear functional roles.
e. The scale and complexity of operations, particularly at divisional level and above, means that command cannot be exercised without the support of a deputy commander who exercises command when the commander is absent from the headquarters. The deputy commander may also be used to control a particular phase or geographical area of the operation which requires forward command.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The command post (CP) is a location from which command is exercised, consisting of a physical structure, the staff and its associated CIS. A force element’s headquarters may be able to create a number of command posts. A CP supports the commander by presenting relevant information, and by providing the means of control and the communications through which orders are passed and information is exchanged. Depending on the level of command, a headquarters is organised to operate a number of command posts. Possible types of command post include a Main CP; a forward CP to allow commanders to command in the forward areas of operations; a Tactical CP to allow the commander and key staff to deploy to the point of battle with a lower profile; and an alternate/step – up CP, to assume control if or when the main CP is unable to do so for tactical or administrative reasons. This combination provides flexibility, reach and endurance but comes with a cost in terms of manpower, protected mobility, infrastructure and communications equipment. In the same manner that commanders reach back from a tactical CP to the main CP for intelligence analysis and other outputs not practically deliverable forward, so too they may be able to reach back for command support outside the theatre of operations. Command exercised from a number of CPs is a distributed command system. Commanders also consider the balance of command outputs to be delivered at subordinate levels and how much the higher formation may need to support the subordinates, or vice versa. factors include CIS, CP infrastructure and manpower and the nature of the operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Control involves the oversight, direction and coordination of assigned forces in accordance with the commander’s plan and intent. At the lowest tactical levels, command and control are often vested in a single individual. At higher levels, it is a key function of the staff to exercise control over certain aspects of operations in accordance with the principle of Mission Command.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mission Command provides staff and subordinates with the opportunity to accomplish the commander’s intent by using their initiative. Normally this approach takes place through decentralised execution, where commanders increase the freedom of action of subordinates, controlling only when absolutely necessary. However, there are times when more centralised execution and tighter levels of control are required, for example during complex operations that involve more than one subordinate operating in close proximity to each other, such as during withdrawals, reliefs of troops, and obstacle crossings. In such cases, commanders need to impose and exercise greater levels of control to ensure the tempo of the operation is sustained and that the possibility of fratricide is minimised. Mission Command is still exercised during these operations but the control of individual elements is more coordinated. Control has two basic forms which are not mutually exclusive and can be used simultaneously.
a. Procedural control relies on the implementation of commonly understood procedures across a force for the regulation of activity within and between force elements. examples are standard operating procedures, boundaries and NATO standardised procedures. Procedural control can, for example, be used to allocate a volume of battlespace to individual elements for a period of time. Although sometimes perceived as an air control technique, procedural control is applied across all environments. for successful Mission Command, the commander always uses only the minimum essential procedural control measures.
b. Positive control allows for active control of activities in real time. It is used when a commander wishes to direct control in a particular place or on specific elements, for specific periods of time. However, even where resolution of the position of friendly forces is good, that of adversaries and the population is seldom sufficiently timely nor accurate enough to support positive control as the sole means of battlespace management.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land operations necessarily demand degrees of control over the activities of many different groups, on the ground and in the air, within a given geographical area. Those aspects of an area of operations that require active management are described as the battlespace, and battlespace management refers to the adaptive means and measures that enable the dynamic synchronisation of activity. Applying battlespace management provides the control mechanisms for effective and efficient execution of Integrated Action, synchronizing, integrating and coordinating battlespace activities with respect to time, forces and capabilities. The key challenge for commanders and staff is enabling maximum freedom of action for subordinates whilst maintaining control consistent with the context and nature of the mission. Of note, tighter measures are typically required as the density and complexity of the battlefield increases. At the tactical level, the spectrum of battlespace management tools include commonly understood symbology used to identify units, locations and functions, to fire support control measures, and information exchange procedures and processes on CIS and targeting systems.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Command and control procedures must be simple, efficient and flexible to enable timely and effective decision making. standard operating procedures (SOPs) (which are set by a higher authority or formation to its subordinates) and standard operating instructions (how SOPs are implemented in a given context) must be clearly written, understood, rehearsed and used.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Headquarters must be adept at using information to exercise control effectively. This requires appropriate procedures and communications systems.
a. At times of high tempo, it is vital to have robust, consistent and well-understood methods. A headquarters requires proficiency in information management (integrated processes and services to provide exploitable information); information exploitation (use of information to gain advantage); information assurance (the confidence that information is reliable, accurate and secure); and information superiority (possessing better information and able to exploit it faster relative to an adversary).
b. These procedures all in turn depend on CIS. These enable control measures to be specified with a high degree of accuracy, allow for changes to be rapidly disseminated across the command, and provide near real-time feedback on the progress of operations to commanders and their staff. CIS capabilities and limitations, such as range, bandwidth and security are factors of all plans.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Directives, plans and orders provide the principal means by which a commander’s intentions are conveyed to subordinates as well as the control framework for the operation. Directives, plans and orders must be concise, clear, accurate and timely.
a. A directive is used at the higher levels of command to initiate activity and to give both general and specific guidance to subordinate commanders. It will be less formal, rigid and prescriptive than an order.
b. Plans are mainly issued for contingency planning purposes and have no executive authority until activated by an order. A ‘plan’ is also the term used to describe the output from the planning process prior to conversion into directives and orders by the commander and staff.
c. Orders are written or oral communications that direct the conduct and synchronisation of action. They are issued in whole or in part to subordinate forces for planning or execution.
The operations process
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders are responsible for making decisions. The primary outputs from their decision-making are the plan, followed by its execution. The process by which commanders and staff conduct planning and execute the plan is called the operations process, as illustrated in figure 1.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
This is a decision-making tool used by NATO tactical formations and by the United States Army up to corps level. Activities within this process include assessment, planning, preparation and execution. The outputs from this process are operations designed to achieve the desired outcomes through objectives, effects and actions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The way in which the operations process is approached depends on a range of factors. These include the context, type of operation, time available, level of headquarters and associated resources. The process is therefore scalable, requiring commanders and staff to be flexible and to focus on the ends rather than be slaves to the process. In all circumstances, commanders and staff must recognise that planning is a command-led activity, and that the operations process is not necessarily sequential. Assessment, which directly influences the other three activities, is constantly refreshed, tested and refined; preparation and planning are continuous.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Assessment is the monitoring and evaluation of the current operational picture. It is continuous throughout planning, preparation and execution. effective assessment is dependent on good situational awareness, to which it also contributes, and provides the basis for the decision-making of commanders and staff. It is a critical supporting activity in the constant fight for understanding. As it surrounds and permeates the entirety of the process, specific discussion of assessment within plan, prepare and execute activities is captured in the relevant paragraphs below. Assessment after the operation is also a key contributor to adaptation. Adaptation leads to the adjustment of doctrine (tactics, techniques and procedures), and the generation of requirements for new or adjusted capability.

<|startoftext|>
Planning determines the commander’s initial balance of effort, within a framework of available time, resources and freedom of action. However, in a dynamic operating environment, pragmatic and flexible plans are more likely to be successful than those that are prescriptive. The commander needs to develop contingency plans to address other outcomes that could be foreseen, and must be poised to cope with the unexpected. Military planning is based on an estimate process.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
An estimate is a logical process of reasoning by which a commander, faced with an ill-structured problem, arrives at a course of action to be taken to achieve the mission. Commanders at all levels use estimates appropriate to the complexity of the problems. The estimates used by the British Army all follow the same broad approach: continuous understanding of the situation; identification of outcomes, objectives and effects to be achieved; selection, resourcing and programming of a particular course of action; and preparation of orders. Depending on the nature of the problem, level of command and immediacy of execution, contingency and branch plans may also be produced for subsequent refinement.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The British Army routinely uses three recognised planning processes. These are compatible with those of other components and NATO land forces, who often employ their own national decision-making processes particularly at the lower tactical level. Interoperability depends more on making the right deductions and knowing how different estimate processes relate to each other, than on adopting a single approach across a joint or multinational force. The use of a particular planning process is determined not by the level of the force, but by the nature of the problem, the time available and the procedural interoperability requirements of the task.
a. Operational-level planning process. At the operational level, commander and their staff use the operational-level planning process to produce a campaign or operational plan. See AJP-5 Allied Joint Doctrine for Operational-level Planning (with UK national elements).
b. tactical estimate. The tactical estimate, also known as the ‘6-step estimate’, is designed for circumstances where military problems are complex and plans may be longer term and involve significant sequencing. The tactical estimate is suitable where there is an emphasis on detailed planning and understanding rather than high-tempo decision-making. It can be used by division, brigade and battlegroup headquarters.
c. Combat estimate. The combat estimate, also known as the ‘7 questions’, is derived from the tactical estimate but presents the analysis, plan creation and decision-making in a sequence of 7 questions. This is intended to make it easy to focus on rapid understanding of the problem and decision-making as part of accelerated battle procedure. It is used at formation level for similarly urgent situations. It can be adapted for more complicated, deliberate actions. It assumes that the operating environment and general tactical situation are already well understood. The combat estimate is designed mainly for use at battlegroup and below to generate plans for single, urgent tactical problems.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Orders are used in all spheres of military activity and at all levels of command. They follow standardised formats to enable swift delivery, comprehension, extraction and execution. Orders are as comprehensive as time allows. An operation order and its subsidiaries, for example, fragmentary orders, include the detail necessary for subordinate commanders to be able to understand the context for the operation. They also need to understand the intent, extracting what it means for them, and what it means to others. Mission Command requires orders which concentrate on imparting an understanding of the context of the operation and what needs to be done rather than how. Attention to detail when producing orders is of paramount importance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The means of delivering orders is contingent on the level of command, time available, nature of operation, physical dispersion of forces and CIS. In combat operations at battlegroup and below, verbal orders (either in person or via CIS) accompanied by a one-page summary are sufficient. At higher levels of command and in more complex scenarios, more detailed written orders will be required. At all levels, orders can be accompanied by diagrams, overlays and schematics to show how dynamic activity is intended to occur in time and space. Wherever possible, a commander issues orders in person and so imbues subordinates with a common purpose and understanding. Subordinates then back-brief their commander to clarify intent, confirm understanding and, where appropriate, recommend further refinement to the plan.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Assessment during planning. Assessment is procedurally ingrained within UK estimates, especially within intelligence preparation of the environment, mission analysis and course of action evaluation. As the plan develops within the estimate process, it is tested against the constantly changing situation to refine the decisions made as well as identify and mitigate risks. Such refinement, drawing on tools of red-teaming, wargaming and operational analysis, precedes the issuing of orders. Of note, planning is typically the stage in the operations process where the staff creates the initial common operating picture from which to achieve shared situation awareness and identify opportunities, threats and information requirements. Assessment during planning also identifies measurements of effectiveness and performance
that are used for subsequent assessment during preparation and execution.
• Format of orders. Orders follow a standardised format of: situation; mission; execution (including concept of operations, missions and tasks, coordinating instructions); combat service support; and command and signal.
• Concepts of operations. The concept of operations describes how the commander intends to achieve the mission. Where possible, the commander would confirm it with the superior commander through the backbrief process. The concept of operations flows directly from his decision and has three elements to it:
• intent. Intent is a concise and precise statement of what the commander intends to do and why, expressed as effects to be created. It is as brief as possible and easy to remember, so that subordinates can know it. It is formulated by the commander.
• scheme of manoeuvre. The scheme of manoeuvre expands the intent to describe how the commander sees the operation unfolding. It explains where, when, how and with what, in relation to each other, the force is to achieve its purpose, so that subordinates can understand their roles in the plan and the effects and actions that they and others are to realise. A clear intent minimises the length of the scheme of manoeuvre, where brevity is an important quality. Schemes of manoeuvre generally use the doctrinal frameworks as a structure. Phases should be used with caution as they can serve to over-control subordinate action.
• Main effort. The main effort is defined as: the concentration of forces or means in a particular area and at a particular time to enable a commander to bring about a decision. It is a conceptual tool by which a commander concentrates forces on the activity considered crucial to the success of the mission and the achievement of the higher commander’s intent. The commander gives it substance by allocating sufficient resources and focusing the task of the force element assigned to it. It is an implied task for all other force elements to enable or support the main effort. The main effort can change during an operation, but this can detract from the crucial activity. It is expressed as an action together with the primary force undertaking it.
• Mission statement. A mission statement is a clear and direct order to a subordinate and consists of actions to be taken and a unifying purpose (effect), proceeded by the words ‘in order to’. There are three types of mission: a single statement with a unifying purpose; a series of tasks with a unifying purpose; and for reserves, a series of ‘be prepared to’ tasks, without a unifying purpose. Missions are listed in a logical order of activity rather than in British Army precedence as this will aid the visualisation of the operation. Tasks contained within mission statements are substantive. Lesser tasks, such as conducting preliminary moves or establishing liaison will normally be omitted from the mission, but may be included elsewhere in the orders, in coordinating instructions for example. Depending on the level of command and circumstances, mission statements are written or approved by the commander personally.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Preparation includes activities conducted by the formation or unit before execution. These activities are designed to improve the formation or unit’s ability to conduct the operation and include, but are not limited to, plan refinement, back-briefs, rehearsals, coordination, reconnaissance and preliminary movement. Preparation of a formation or unit for a specific operation starts with receipt of a warning order and ends when execution begins. Sound, efficient battle procedure is key to making preparation fit the time available, in order to contribute to tempo.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Assessment during preparation. Assessment during preparation monitors the progress of readiness to conduct the operation and assists in plan refinement. In relation to the latter, commanders need the agility to adjust the plan based on new information and changing circumstances. for example, the enemy will do the unexpected, unforeseen opportunities may arise, assumptions on which the plan is based may be proven true or false and friendly forces status may change. In any of these cases the change must be assessed against the plan and the commander must decide if the new information:
a. validates the plan with no further changes;
b. requires minor adjustments to the plan;
c. requires major adjustments to the plan; or
d. invalidates the mission and so requires direction from the superior commander. If there is not time to consult higher, then commanders act to support the one-up intent and main effort whilst considering the context of the two-up intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The operations process places significant emphasis on the requirement to continually assess, test and refine a plan. At corps and division level, there may be a significant time gap between the initial preparation of a plan and its execution, demanding a focused effort to refine and adjust the plan to reflect the latest understanding of the requirement and context. At brigade level and below during combat operations, planning may flow immediately into execution. In all circumstances, commanders and staff continually monitor the situation and must be prepared to refine a plan even after orders have been delivered.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The execution of an operation begins when committed assets physically enact their issued orders. Overcoming friction, maintaining tempo and enabling Mission Command relies heavily upon the personal involvement of the commander, supported by the staff. Command is complemented by control which is further sub-divided into two elements – monitoring and coordination. The latter is a function of the headquarters staff who implement the commander’s plan and make adjustments when required. Maintaining accurate and timely situational awareness across the span of command is fundamental to successful execution.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Assessment during execution. During execution of an operation, assessment considers the unfolding situation against that which was planned for and allows refinements to be made to mitigate or exploit the identified change. The situation may change for a wide variety of reasons. friendly, enemy, neutral and environmental activity and information will all have an impact and cause an under- or over- delivery of the plan. At the lower tactical levels and during simple operations, the commander may be able to conduct the assessment function with limited support. During more complex operations, the commander will rely more heavily on the staff to analyse the situation and so assist decision making. The two key measurements to inform this analysis are measurement of performance (assessment of the performance of a task and achievement of the associated purpose) and measurement of effectiveness (assessment of change against intended progress). The way in which performance and effect are measured are considered in the planning stage.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At every level in the force, after each operation or major event and continuously during longer campaigns, commanders review the performance and capability of the force to enable rapid and successful adaptation. To be genuine, this command- led activity requires an appropriate command climate, and engaged, flexible and objective participants. The aim is to identify experiences, examples and observations that can contribute positively to future tasks and operations. It relies on commanders at all levels to recognise that success on operations depends significantly on rapid and relevant learning across the whole force, in competition with adversaries and enemies. In the operations process, post-operational assessment informs planning for the next cycle of operations. Post operational assessment is also central to deeper institutional learning and capability development. Capability is improved only when the lessons identified and observations are implemented by those in the home base responsible for force development, equipment acquisition, doctrine and training.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land operations require commanders at all levels to identify and seize opportunities. But they also necessarily involve significant and often fatal risks. Understanding risk is therefore essential. Military organisations broadly understand risk as: potentially damaging; made up of cause, effect and consequence; explained in terms of likelihood or probability and impact; and something that has to be accepted on the route to success. Distinction is also made between operational and operating risks. Clarity of communication within the land force and with NATO allies is imperative and so this doctrine uses the term risk as it is commonly understood and defined by the Concise Oxford english Dictionary: “the possibility that something unpleasant may happen”. Risks, therefore, are described as the possibility of negative outcomes in relation to the force or the mission. The events or conditions that lead to those negative outcomes are causes. The interplay between cause and effect is inherently uncertain and requires commanders and staff to manage risk. Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and controlling risk arising from operational factors, and making informed decisions that balance risk with mission benefits.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
To achieve success, commanders have to judge and accept risks. Taking risk is inherent in effective military operations, in which commanders at all levels achieve their intent by seeking opportunities then vigorously seizing and exploiting them. But adversary and enemy actions and the difficulty of overcoming friction mean that operations are not guaranteed to succeed and the force may incur losses. enemies and adversaries aim to defeat or destroy the force or elements of it, or in other ways to prevent the mission from being achieved. Many military activities are inherently dangerous even without enemy involvement; friction compounds the difficulty. even when a mission or task is successful, equipment may be lost and casualties taken. The nature of conflict means that military activity is seldom, if ever, risk-free.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Risk has different implications at different levels of operations, with actions taken at one level potentially incurring risk at another. Many contemporary operations are conducted in a context where there is a low tolerance of casualties. At the tactical level, to judge what is appropriate, commanders need to understand the risk appetite at the higher levels of command. for example, if there is little political appetite for casualties in an operation, then tactical actions that incur casualties can cause strategic risk. Conversely, if strategic risk might be caused by the failure of a particular mission, then tactical commanders may have to accept the risk of a greater loss of life to achieve it. Risk appetite is not fixed; it is contextually dependent and differs from one operation to another, as well as within a single operation. It will also differ between allied and coalition partners.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are two different types of operational risk that a land force and its commander face: risk to force, comprising its loss or damage to its fighting Power; and risk to mission. These risks are not mutually exclusive; for example loss of fighting Power can prevent achievement of the mission. Multiple, compound risks, where as one risk materialises it exposes a force to the others, are the most dangerous.
a. risk to force.
(1) The risk of loss of the force, or elements of it, is often associated with warfighting, but at low level in stability operations, the loss of a patrol or a sub- unit can be a risk (a risk with strategic consequences). There are many famous historical examples of this risk being accepted; the expedition to recover the falkland Islands in 1982, and the Battle of Goose Green during that campaign are two examples. Of course acceptance of the risk does not guarantee operational success; at the Battle of Arnhem in 1944 a British airborne division which dropped behind German lines was destroyed as the corps due to link-up with it failed in its mission, with the result that a crossing over the Rhine was not achieved for several months. It is rare to knowingly accept a high risk of loss of part the force, unless it is the best or only way to achieve the overall mission and the context is such that the risk is tolerable.
(2) The second risk to the force is that of damage to Fighting Power. In isolation this risk is the chance of casualties or loss of equipment and materiel with little risk to the overall force or the outcome of the operation. In combat, the risk of casualties is often high, even unavoidable. The degree to which this risk is acceptable depends on the circumstances. At a purely practical level, loss of equipment, materiel and personnel reduces the physical and moral components of the force’s fighting Power and damages the force’s reputation. However, even if these losses are tolerable at the tactical level, they may be intolerable at the strategic level. Such situations require very acute judgement of appropriate risks by commanders and staff. They must fully understand the strategic context and risk appetite and ensure that operations are conducted accordingly. At the same time, they must not allow the force to develop such a protective mind-set that it cannot achieve the mission. Operational design must seek to protect this strategic vulnerability from attack at the tactical level.
b. risk to mission. On its own, this risk is the possibility that the mission will not succeed, but there is no significant risk to the force. The risk might range in severity from the risk to a single task, to the risk that an entire campaign may fail. In these cases if the mission is imperative then the risk can only be mitigated by, for example, finding a different course of action, applying more resources, or finding some other way of changing the risk equation. If the mission or task is not imperative to achieving intent then it may not be worth carrying out the task or mission.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Some risks can be foreseen and so planned against; others cannot and arise through chance and friction, intrinsic to the nature of conflict. By thinking laterally and constantly updating their situational understanding, land forces will be better prepared when managing emergent risks. foreseen or unforeseen, the causes of military risk fall into three broad groups – adversary actions, environmental factors and our own actions. These groups are not exclusive.
a. In conflict, forces are in a contest with their adversaries and enemies; each side is seeking to create, identify and exploit weaknesses in the other side. All enemies and adversaries are intelligent, dynamic actors, directed by their command and control authorities and systems. They can be the cause of both types of risk: threatening the cohesion or even existence of the force or elements of it; or preventing achievement of tasks, missions or wider objectives.
b. Terrain, distance, climate, weather, disease and darkness are examples of environmental factors that cause friction. These factors can increase the probability of mission failure and attrition of the force.
c. Inappropriate actions can cause the force or elements of it to fail to achieve their objectives, or can increase its vulnerability to enemy action or environmental factors. These can be, for example, errors of judgement, planning, execution and resourcing, either independent of the enemy threat or environmental factors, or in relation to those threats. In some cases it may simply be bad luck, for example, an equipment failure, but more often the cause is either incompetence or a misreading of the situation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
risk management. Ultimately the commander of any force, supported where applicable by the staff, is responsible for judging and accepting risk. This involves understanding in each case the potential causes, the likelihood or probability of the risks, their impacts and the context of operations. The key is to recognise the risks, mitigate the causes where possible, knowingly accept the residual risk, and where possible prepare contingency plans to deal with the causes and their consequences if required. Three factors warrant particular consideration when managing risk.
a. First, human beings can easily misjudge risk. They can over- or under-estimate it or fail to notice it altogether, depending on the operational situation, group context and dynamics (for example, informed by unit culture) and individual personalities. Objective guides can be very useful, allowing the staff to identify, assess and track risks to act as a ‘handrail’ for commanders’ decisions. At formation level, risk management tools, supported by operational analysis, can provide a useful, objective measure of risk; these are described in joint and lower-level Army doctrine. At the lower tactical levels, certainly at unit level and below, risk management is usually straightforward. Units usually operate in a formation context, so much of the risk management is done for them. In that context, units and sub-units identify and plan mitigation by using the combat estimate process, including wargaming and rehearsals. This allows concurrent considerations of risks and opportunities.
b. Second, the least controllable cause of risk is other actors, particularly enemies. environmental factors may be hard to overcome, but they do not fight back. friendly causes involve the complication of human actions but the threat from this source can be mitigated. Mitigation measures include selection of appropriate commanders and staff, training and allocation of adequate resources. The enemy, however, actively seeks to cause casualties, prevent us achieving the mission, and if they can, to defeat or even destroy us. A passive, reactive approach cannot succeed in fully eliminating the enemy threat. The risk that the enemy presents can ultimately only be overcome by active measures. The Manoeuvrist Approach emphasises offensive action to seize and retain the initiative, compelling enemies and adversaries to respond to our actions. Stability operations also require us to take the initiative. Whenever there is a human threat, it is usually best to act to make the threat respond to our actions, rather than the other way round.
c. Operating some capabilities (including, for example, helicopters) involves complex technical risks to life that can only be fully understood by qualified and experienced specialists. Defence places a personal duty on specific individuals to manage these operating risks, both in training and during operations. The commander must seek the advice of the duty holder or the delegated representative if the capability is to be employed in a way that increases the risk to life above the level that would be tolerated in routine activities. On operations, the commander judges whether the operational risk to the mission warrants acceptance of increased operating risk. exceptionally, a commander may also decide to employ the capability without specialist advice if urgency precludes consultation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustainment is the business of maintaining the force. Through logistic and administrative support, it seeks to enhance the force’s resilience and enable it to endure for as long as operationally necessary. It is hugely important to military success, as only forces that are adequately sustained can succeed. Sustainment is a key factor underpinning the concept of culmination. A force that over-reaches itself will become increasingly unsustainable, and its tactical options will be reduced to the point of being ineffective. Throughout military history successful commanders have recognised this significance. As a divisional commander during the 1991 Gulf War, General Rupert Smith put it simply: “... a commander [should] only fight the battle he can sustain.”
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Before conducting operations commanders must ensure that they are able to deploy, sustain and regenerate their forces. They must understand the freedoms and constraints that sustainment provides including considering the implications of casualties and the consumption of materiel. They then plan, allocate and balance resources accordingly. Commanders also evaluate the risks to their sustainment assets and infrastructure, and then adapt their plans to reduce the impact of sustainment constraints while exploiting the tactical freedoms sustainment provides.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustaining a land force depends on strategic and joint operational level systems, processes and resources, but within the land environment at the tactical level it is fundamentally a land component responsibility. This chapter defines key terminology, and describes the philosophy and principles of land sustainment. It then introduces the functional groupings that sustain tactical land forces, before explaining how sustainment is planned and executed in the land environment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Given the inherently joint context of sustainment, adherence to joint and NATO terminology is important. See AAP-06 and JDP 4-00, Logistics for Joint Operations for further detail.
a. sustainability is the ability of a force to maintain the necessary level of combat power for the duration required to achieve its objectives without culmination. It is a Principle of War.
b. sustainment describes those logistic and administrative activities and resources necessary to sustain a force. It is a tactical function.
(1) Logistics is the science of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of forces. Logistics comprises the development, acquisition, storage, movement, distribution, maintenance, recovery and disposal of materiel; transport of personnel, acquisition and construction; maintenance, operation and disposal of facilities; acquisition or furnishing of services; and medical and health services.
(2) Administration is the provision and implementation of regulations and procedures related to the management of an organisation in support of the accomplishment of the mission.
c. Combat service support is the support provided to the force, primarily in the fields of administration and logistics. This term is usually used in reference to functional groups of logistic, health service, equipment, infrastructure and administrative support.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At the tactical level in the land environment, the British Army is guided by the philosophy of land sustainment. first, sustainment is central to fighting Power; the capability of a land force depends on its sustainability. Second, sustainment is a means to an end. Sustainment should always support the mission, although there may be occasions where it is the mission, for example, in humanitarian assistance operations. Third, sustainment is everyone’s responsibility; all members of the land force have an individual and collective responsibility for sustainment. fourth, the agility of the force depends on agile sustainment, which in turn requires a support network rather than just linear supply chains. finally, while sustainment requires specialist skills, those military personnel who provide sustainment are soldiers first and specialists second.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The principles of logistics inform the planning and execution of sustainment by land forces. The descriptions of each principle reflect the context of tactical land forces, and so have been adapted from those of NATO which focus on operational level sustainment. NATO, joint and lower-level land doctrine describe complementary functional principles, relevant to specific forms of sustainment (for example, AJP-4.10, Allied Doctrine for Medical Support describes the fundamental principles of medical support.)
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The principles of logistics
• Collective responsibility. Collective responsibility requires all elements of the land force to share logistic information, capabilities and resources to support the force. Such cooperation combined with robust sustainment command and control provides the foundation for the flexible and efficient use of sustainment capabilities thereby contributing to operational success.
• Authority. When responsibility is assigned for the sustainment of forces, it must be accompanied with the appropriate level of authority to direct and control activities to achieve the sustainment required.
• Primacy of operational requirement. Sustainment effort is focused to meet the requirements necessary to support operational activity. Although prioritisation may be required, for example when preparing forces for theatre exit, the needs of operational activity come first.
• Coordination and cooperation. Cooperation and coordination in all sustainment activities including between civilian and military providers, will contribute to the best use of limited resources. Cooperation is best engendered through shared training, developing interoperability, team spirit and cohesion. It relies upon: mutual trust and goodwill; unity of purpose, if not command; and agreed understanding of responsibilities, freedoms and limitations.
• Assured provision. Commanders at all levels ensure the provision of sustainment resources to support the forces and capabilities allocated to them.
• sufficiency. Sustainment is available in the necessary quantity and quality, when and where it is required throughout all types of operations and tactical activities.
• efficiency. efficiency involves achieving the maximum level of support for the least sustainment effort to make the best use of finite resources, the supply network and lines of communication. Logistic and administrative efficiency will ultimately determine the most appropriate operational structures and resources to support an operation.
• simplicity. The complexity of sustainment activity demands a robust plan that is widely understood and that absorbs friction. Simplicity enables plans, systems and organisations to react well to the unforeseen.
• Flexibility. Sustainment must be adaptive and flexible to be effective. Adequate planning allows force elements to react in a timely manner to changes in the operational situation.
• visibility. Commanders require timely, accurate and relevant information to make effective decisions and to plan and coordinate sustainment activity. Visibility of the wider force’s support arrangements (for example, lines of communication and transit areas) will assist commanders in the planning and execution of operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are five main combat service support functional groupings: logistic support, health service support, equipment support, infrastructure support and administration.
a. Logistic support links a deployed force to its sustaining nodes using four echelons: unit, formation, force or theatre, and the strategic base. The activities of logistic support groupings include the provision of materiel which includes the procurement, storage, management and configuration, assurance and distribution of supplies; the provision of movement to deploy a force and provide movement within a theatre; and a wide range of logistic support services which include enabling, health, safety, sanitation and other services directly in support of the maintenance of morale.
b. health service support contributes to the physical and moral components of fighting Power through maximising, protecting and restoring the health of the force. It provides effective and timely treatment and, where necessary, evacuation of those who become ill and injured. When deployed, it provides the capability to manage casualties from the point of injury (or onset of illness) to definitive treatment. Health service support has logistic and administrative aspects and, apart from the furthest forward units, is usually planned and conducted as a joint capability.
c. equipment support seeks to keep the required quantity of operational equipment available to the force. This is achieved by the active management and maintenance of equipment and equipment components. Maintenance is organised into four levels which are determined by the complexity and engineering requirements of the task.
d. infrastructure support provides the operational estate which consists of operational and host nation infrastructure. Infrastructure includes fixed installations, fabrications, physical structures and facilities, including utilities. Infrastructure is built and sustained through engineering. This engineering is provided by a combination of a military construction force and contractors.
e. Administrative support is the management and execution of all non-tactical military preparation and activity. It includes staff and personnel support; medical force preparation and preventative health service support; welfare support; provost support, including military police and investigative services; budget and financial advice; and civil and policy affairs advice.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within the tactical land environment, the force is sustained by a support network. This network has two features. first, it interconnects the primary lines of communication, making the supply chain more efficient and responsive. Logistic movement in a network is lateral as well as forward and back. Materiel and people are moved to and from points of need through a network of nodes and links. This requires an imaginative approach, exploiting alternative routes and unconventional means. This is only possible with shared understanding enabled by logistic information systems. Second, the support network is resourced through all available means, harnessing contracted, joint, allied and host nation capabilities alongside those of land forces as part of the whole force approach. The network will then be adaptive (able to adjust quickly to the loss of key nodes or routes) and agile (able to cope with rapidly changing demands). early and comprehensive logistic planning, especially when operating over extended distances, is essential. It informs the likely logistic requirements, appropriate development of the support network and significantly influences the design of the entire operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The sustainment estimate considers the logistic and the administrative requirements of an operational plan, including the requirements and structure of the support network. It is undertaken concurrently and in collaboration with the main estimate process and needs to be delivered in time for operational commanders to assess whether they need to adjust their plans. Guided by the philosophy of sustainment and principles of logistics, the sustainment estimate should include consideration of sustainment planning factors, sustainment reach and risks, and contractor support.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustainment activity often has long lead times. An understanding of four key sustainment planning factors helps to predict requirements in order to meet them on time. These are known as the ‘four Ds’ – destination, distance, demand and duration. They apply to both troops and materiel
a. Destination refers to the physical environment of the operation, including the degree of dispersion of the force. How the environment might affect equipment and personnel informs appropriate preventative measures.
b. Distance refers to strategic, operational and tactical lines of communication, including the threats to them, their capacity and topography. These factors affect how troops and resources are deployed, and guide the design of the resupply and evacuation aspects of the support network.
c. Demand is influenced by the type and grouping of the force requiring support, and its corresponding rates and amounts of consumption. Demand stems from the commander’s intent and the tactical activities that it leads to. It has three elements.
(1) Steady-state demand represents daily sustainment needs that have little variation, such as predictable non-battle injuries or the consumption of rations.
(2) Cyclical demand represents additional needs to the steady state, caused, for example, by seasonal conditions.
(3) Surge demand is driven by increases in activity. It is the least easy to predict and the most susceptible to variation. Surge demand requires a network of responsive command systems, reserve stocks and a delivery capability able to switch between priorities.
d. Duration refers to the length of the operation. This and the rate of demand inform the quantities of personnel and materiel required, and the need to rotate or replace them. Commanders must balance the risks of a rapid, lightly-supported operation against those of a better-resourced, more deliberate operation that takes longer to mount.

<|startoftext|>
Commanders and staff must also consider sustainment reach. This defines the limit at which a force can assure sustainment. It requires an assessment of the optimum design for the support network required and the balance between directed logistics and stockpiling forward. Beyond this reach, a force may culminate, be cut off or become fixed, unless stockpiles are created. Reach is affected by the availability of stocks and movement assets as well as by the ‘four Ds’: destination by terrain, obstacles, and climate; distance by the length of the re-supply loop, dispersal of force elements and timeliness of casualty evacuation; demand by the type of operation; and duration by stock consumption. Reach starts in the sustaining base or node and ends where the item is used.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In effective sustainment, concentration of resources at critical points is informed by a commander’s designation of the main effort and may require risk to be taken elsewhere. In planning, two aspects of sustainment risk should be considered:
a. Sustainment planning should assess where risks may be taken so as to achieve adaptability and agility while enhancing freedom of manoeuvre. This is done by expressing sustainment reach in terms of options available to the commander, with resulting constraints or freedoms. excessive pessimism or attempting to over-insure should be avoided.
b. Reduction in the volume of stocks increases the vulnerability of supply to unforeseen circumstances. Sustainment assets have an easily identifiable signature and they operate along obvious lines of communication between potentially obvious nodes, so they need to be protected against detection and attack. They can be protected by enhancing their integral defence capability; using deception and camouflage; integrating them into a scheme of manoeuvre; or by allocating other forces to their defence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Contractors and Defence agency personnel in the strategic base and on deployed operations are elements of the whole force approach. They can significantly enhance the ability to provide sustainment to the force. Their involvement releases finite military logistic resources and provides niche capabilities beyond military functional skills. Although the employment of deployed contractors will depend on the permissiveness of the environment, contractors will feature in the battlespace even during combat. To maximise the benefits of contractors and to minimise the risks inherent in their use, it is essential that they are integrated into the force at the earliest opportunity and under a clear commercial strategy. However, there will be constraints, such as contractual limitations; requirements to provide force protection; ability to coordinate contractor activities and influence their behaviour in the battlespace; and dealing with the risks of using them, not least that they might withdraw from operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustainment execution consists of synchronised activity covering the overlapping stages of prepare, project, sustain and the restoration of combat power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Prepare. Sustainment preparation and pre-deployment activities include defining the requirements for lines of communication, developing a sustainability statement, preparing a force administratively and medically, and determining theatre and logistic command structures. The identification, acquisition and integration of urgent capability requirements and establishing the theatre entry standards of equipment is undertaken as early as possible. early logistic planning allows the assessment of potential deployment areas, including infrastructure such as ports of disembarkation, road, rail and inland waterways, materiel and resources. It will indicate the potential for using host nation capability to support the force. Stocks are checked, configured and prepared for out- loading, including those required for reception, staging and onward integration (RSOI).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Project. Projecting forces into a theatre establishes the lines of communication and the initial support network to receive and prepare incoming forces. It includes mounting, strategic deployment and RSOI. enabling capabilities, such as reconnaissance, and movement teams, are among the first into theatre with the joint theatre entry operation. Stocks can be moved by air, sea or land to sustain the force. RSOI is normally provided by a joint force logistic organisation, another formation headquarters or the headquarters of one of its units. The land force commander is responsible for ensuring that RSOI is conducted effectively.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustain. The type, range and scale of sustainment tasks will naturally differ depending on the nature of the force being sustained. However, the size of a force will not always be directly reflected by the scale and complexity of the support required, for example sustaining a small team operating in isolation and at reach can require considerable sustainment effort relative to its size. In general terms, establishing and operating the support network to sustain the deployed force involves a number of key activities.
a. Sources of supply are located to support tactical activities and so ensure the supply and distribution of materiel, and the management of casualties. Assistance may also be required to support, for example, the redeployment of formations.
b. Infrastructure and facilities are created to sustain the force in theatre. Their purpose is to link incoming units and formations with their equipment; carry out modifications; and deploy the force to its training, acclimatisation or operational locations. Infrastructure and facilities can then be used to sustain the force during operations. Logistic expertise is required to coordinate port, maritime, movements, supply, local purchase, fuel handling, catering, water, sanitation and engineering and construction tasks. These activities all contribute to Integrated Action: local employment may be created; resources are injected into the economy; and infrastructure improvements that benefit the force, should be designed to also benefit the local population wherever possible.
c. Legal tasks include advice to the commander on International Humanitarian Law, ROE and targeting, the Regulatory and Investigatory Powers Act and detention. finance tasks include the provision of civil secretariat assistance to funding and accounting.
d. Interruption of operational sustainment by adversaries or the impact of the actions by actors should be expected. Dedicated forces may be required to protect nodes, installations and lines of communication.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Following combat, or at the conclusion of an operation, restoring combat power is enabled through the rehabilitation, reconstitution, redeployment and recuperation of the force.
a. The rehabilitation of personnel and equipment and the reconstitution of units and formations may be required during and after combat or other types of operation. Rehabilitation and reconstitution usually take place in-theatre and the resources for rehabilitation are usually controlled at the operational level.
b. When an operation has been concluded, the force (personnel, equipment and stocks) are redeployed back to the home base. Redeployment of the force is planned at the strategic level. Redeployment can be as simple as executing the deployment force element Table in reverse, or it can be a highly complex process. Regardless of the level of complexity, it is vital that redeployment is planned and correctly synchronised, with planning undertaken as part of the initial deployment process. Redeployment from operations includes recovery into a port of embarkation; clean-up and rehabilitation of equipment; repackaging of unused materiel; environmental clean-up; and movement back to a home base. An explicit theatre closure phase may be required, requiring additional logistic units to be deployed and an additional logistic unit headquarters to provide command and control for the theatre drawdown. Specific capabilities may deploy to help close locations, assist with drawing down support activities and provide specialist assets, skills and advice to redeploy personnel and materiel. Contractors may deliver this function when enabled through early planning and integration.
c. recuperation mainly takes place in the strategic base and is designed to bring force elements and materiel back to their pre-operational readiness level. It has two components:
(1) recuperation of people needs to be planned in detail during the operation and includes the rest, care and employment of casualties and care of the families of casualties. Recuperation also involves remembrance; recovery of the training foundation, particularly for those units who were deployed in new roles and need to revert to others; learning lessons from operations; and education and personal career development. Recuperation of people is an essential part of restoring the moral component of fighting Power.
(2) Recuperation is also the process by which unused stocks are inspected and returned for storage or disposal, depleted stocks are replenished, and materiel and equipment is returned to pre-operation standards and levels of availability. recuperation of materiel is a complex activity that is likely to involve lengthy, in-depth planning, a considerable amount of time to execute and significant force elements and other resources to conduct. An attitude must be fostered across the force that the equipment that has served it on operations should be made ready immediately, before the force stands down, for future operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustainment not just a matter for specialists: it is the business of everyone in the force. All professional soldiers should understand the nature of sustainment and the freedoms and constraints it provides so their operational intentions can become actionable plans, actions and effects. Two general requirements for individuals, teams and the chain of command flow from this.
a. every member of a land force requires sufficient awareness of how the force is sustained, logistically and administratively, to be able to contribute positively to both. At an individual level, this includes: doctrinal understanding; flexibility and pragmatism; anticipating needs; expressing requirements clearly; and sufficient familiarity with equipment and materiel to use them responsibly and efficiently.
b. Diligence requires a consistent, conscientious level of attention to detail and care. It requires a professional attitude of mind that abhors waste, conscientiously maintains equipment, infrastructure and materiel, and is meticulous in administration.

Sustainment - Marlborough’s March to the Danube 1704
The Duke of Marlborough is perhaps best remembered for his great victory at Blenheim in 1704 during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1715). But this victory was only possible because of the care given by Marlborough to the sustainment of his forces in the manoeuvres leading up to the battle. In May 1704 a possible franco-Bavarian invasion threatened to knock Austria out of the Grand Alliance against france. In a decisive move Marlborough led his army (one third British, two thirds German and Danish) on a surprise march down the Rhine from the Netherlands,
so that with the Austrians he could pre-emptively defeat the invaders in Bavaria. He had to move his army of over 40,000 men more than 250 miles. In the 18th century, such
long marches were seldom attempted, as they were so hard to sustain. Armies of that period typically used a system of wagon-based supply tied to static magazines. This made it difficult to sustain forces beyond about 60 miles from their depots. But Marlborough’s march was superbly organised. One of his officers noted that “never was such a march carried on with more order and regularity, and with less fatigue to both man and horse.” The Duke unshackled his army from the limitations of the existing supply system by utilising river supply, local contractors and political leverage. Supply officers preceded his army and organised the positioning ahead of the army of the necessary logistic support at key points along the march. These supplies were obtained by local contractors, who were
well paid for their services, and through arrangements with local political authorities. Marlborough’s meticulous planning provided a series of wagon convoys which included nails, ropes, saddlery, medical supplies, bricks to make bread ovens, along with hundreds of ammunition wagons. Given the primitive transport systems of the time, the Duke and his staff worked wonders. Apart from the men’s needs, Marlborough had to provide for 14,000 cavalry horses, 5,000 artillery horses and 4,000 draft animals. The horses alone needed 100 tons of oats a day to remain in good health. Nothing escaped Marlborough’s methodical eye. When the army arrived in Heidelberg, the infantry found fresh boots waiting for them. Weeks before, the Duke’s funds had set local cobblers to work, resulting in 14 battalions being newly shod. In 35 days Marlborough’s army had covered over 250 miles and linked up with Eugène’s Austrians. Two weeks later they fought and won the battle of Blenheim forcing Bavaria to withdraw from the war and saving Vienna.

The purpose of United Kingdom Defence Doctrine (UKDD) is to explain the military instrument of power and its utility both in and beyond warfare. Professions are defined in part by their bodies of professional knowledge and UKDD is part of ours. While UKDD is authoritative, it requires judgement in its application. Doctrine draws on the lessons of history, upon original thinking and from experiences gained from training and operations. It sets out the fundamental principles by which military force is employed. The level of military doctrine covered in this publication is, for the most part, intended to be enduring. This edition of UKDD refreshes British Defence Doctrine (4th Edition) and, without losing the importance of hard power and excellence in war-fighting, better explains the full spectrum utility of Defence. It also incorporates developments such as the whole force concept and the importance of cyber to the UK’s security considerations. UKDD should be read by all officers of the Armed Forces, both in regular and reserve service. I also commend it all MOD Civil Service personnel. Initial training should introduce this doctrine and all stages of subsequent training and education should re-visit it to extend our understanding and competence. UKDD is of particular relevance to officers of mid-seniority and above, in command and staff appointments. Whoever reads this doctrine should, however, remember that it can never replace individual initiative. Doctrine is a guide to commanders and subordinates on how to think, not what to think.

<|startoftext|>
Our national security encompasses the safety of our state and protecting it from external and internal threats. It also requires us to endeavour to preserve the security of UK nationals living overseas. External threats may lead to invasion, attack or blockade. Internal threats may include terrorism, subversion, civil disorder, criminality, insurgency, sabotage and espionage. Other threats include instability caused by financial crisis, climatic events, cyber or other forms of attack on critical national infrastructure and the possibility of pandemic disease. We cannot maintain our own security in isolation. Our national security is both integrated within, and dependent upon, our neighbours’ and partners’ security.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Maintaining authority and stability within democratic states requires meeting the legitimate political, economic, societal, religious and environmental needs of individuals and groups. These needs are usually expressed collectively as human security. Internal threats may be externally-sponsored, but are only likely to jeopardise the stability of a state when they receive internal popular support and challenge established authority. Characteristics of, and threats to, human security are shown below in Table 1
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Increased competition for resources within a globalised world increases the threat to human security. A lack of, or threat to, human security undermines the stability of a state or region. Individuals may transfer loyalty to any group that appears, or promises, to meet their needs. These groups include non-governmental and transnational structures, and organisations that may exist temporarily and/or, in part, virtually. Once such groups receive popular backing, the threat to security increases. Those benefiting from insecurity may seek to perpetuate crises and attempt to undermine any national or international response.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Providing human security demands an awareness of the needs of individuals as well as states. Therefore, providing security requires an understanding of the impact of factors on a society including:
• ideology and politics;
• education;
• commercial and economic factors;
• humanitarian and health issues;
• freedom of movement and information;
• aspiration and contentment;
• attitude to gender equality;
• racial, ethnic and religious factors;
• the military; and
• diplomacy, administration and governance.
These factors, shaped by history and culture, must be considered in context.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK’s security is rooted in perceptions of both national sovereignty and national interests, and how these are both protected and promoted. Our government’s prime duty is to maintain the freedom and integrity of the UK, its Overseas Territories and its people. The government also seeks to secure a range of broader interests – political, economic and social – that contribute to the nation’s strength and prosperity. Our commitment, with our allies and partners, to strengthening international peace and security enhances our national security.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Our security is shaped by a complex combination of geostrategic factors, including environmental, resource, social, political, scientific, technological and military aspects. Our global perspective is also shaped by our responsibility for over five million British citizens who live and work overseas, and our diverse population.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK is a prominent international actor, with numerous interests overseas and a role to play in maintaining international stability and law. Our stability, prosperity and well-being depend on international trade and investment. This requires importing raw materials from overseas, exporting goods by sea, land and air, and access to global information flows. The UK is also one of the world’s largest international investors.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We constantly review our security and modify our approach in response to events, emerging priorities and an informed view of the future. Some factors are of enduring significance, but none can be regarded in isolation and all may vary in importance over time. Therefore, the MOD identifies strategic trends and analyses how they may affect the future security environment. These assessments offer a range of potential outcomes, subject to chance and contingency, and the possible impact of strategic shocks. They inform policy-makers of future possibilities and potential problems, as well as their likely security implications.
Collective security
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, the UK has
an important role, and/or responsibility, in maintaining the international world order. To enhance mutual international security and prosperity, the UK also seeks to extend its influence internationally by collaborating on a broad agenda of issues and challenges. Our ability to project and employ our Armed Forces is one factor within this multilateral system.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Alliances and partnerships are fundamental to our approach to defence and security. Collective security is built upon three principles: 
• the primacy of diplomacy to resolve disputes;
• agreement to act collectively; and
• trust.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In the context of politics, international security and cooperation, the UK prefers to work with its many friends and allies to maintain the international order and the UK’s position within it. Collective security is an essential pillar of the UK’s overall security strategy. This is promoted through our membership of NATO, close relationships with the USA and France, the Five Powers Defence Arrangement, and membership of major international organisations such as the UN, EU and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. Other multilateral organisations that can help underpin a robust rules-based international system include the G8, the G20, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, the International Monetary Fund and the Commonwealth. The UK also supports and cooperates with other international bodies working to increase global and regional security including the African Union and the Gulf Cooperation Council.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Maintaining alliances and relationships generate significant diplomatic, economic and military advantage. The advantages offered by collective security also entail obligations and the UK may need to use force overseas to meet these.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK’s National Security Strategy (2010) describes our national interests as security, prosperity and freedom. Such interests are interconnected and mutually supporting. Without security and the ability of UK residents to live their lives freely, the foundations of prosperity would be undermined. While our freedom to engage internationally brings opportunities, it makes us vulnerable to overseas events, including conflict. This means we may need to act abroad, with force if necessary, to defend our legitimate interests.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Our national interests are underpinned by a secure and resilient UK and by shaping a stable world. This requires that we mitigate risks to our interests, both at home and abroad, using all the instruments of national power. We must shape the global environment and, where possible, tackle potential threats at source. However, it is not the role of Defence to define national interest, that is the responsibility of the government and ministers.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding is defined as: the perception and interpretation of a particular situation in order to provide the context. Insight and foresight are required for effective decision-making. Understanding should not be confused with intelligence or information. Understanding in the context of our national interest:
• informs choice on developing state policy and strategies; and
• supports the application of national power to achieve influence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As a global actor, we interact with differing cultures, ethnic groups and races. Therefore, it is crucial that we develop and maintain understanding of those we wish to influence. Understanding also helps us to avert crises through applying soft power (covered in Chapter 3, Section 3). While Defence will develop understanding, it must not do so in isolation and we must work closely with our partners which allows different perspectives to be considered.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Attempts to solve major security issues by military means alone seldom succeed in the long term, even if initially enjoying apparent success. Only by understanding the dynamics of any particular situation or crisis can the appropriate range of responses be planned and orchestrated. These may be conducted by:
• other government departments;
• international organisations;
• non-governmental organisations;
• other governments;
• private and commercial actors; and
• local and regional populations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Building understanding is an active process. Commanders must guard against relying on experience or mental models that served them well in prior situations. In a world where competitive and contextual circumstances are subject to change, these biases can lead to poor decision-making and costly mistakes. Understanding must be built on up-to-date information, self-awareness, critical analysis, collaboration and creative thinking.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Conducting international politics involves applying national power, within the international system, to support our national or collective interests. This involves collaborating and coordinating with allies and partners. Political outcomes and objectives are articulated in policy.
• Policy articulates a choice leading to a course of action proposed or adopted by a government. Policy is a statement of intent, or a commitment to act.
• Strategy is creating and orchestrating the instruments of power in support of long-term policy objectives. Together, policy and strategy describe what we need to achieve (the ends), how we will do this (the ways) and the resources we need (the means). While policy and strategy are shaped by external factors, they are inter-dependent. Policy only works if there is a credible strategy to deliver it and strategy demands an achievable policy end-state. Advice to policy-makers is only effective when it comprises an honest, realistic appraisal of both current and future capabilities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In a globalised, competitive world, states will legitimately set out to secure their own interests and achieve influence. The UK’s national strategy coordinates the instruments of national power in pursuit of national policy aims to secure our interests. The Prime Minister and Cabinet are responsible for the UK’s national strategy. The government’s political intentions are articulated as a national strategic aim or end-state, supported by strategic objectives. Our national strategy is contested globally within the diplomatic, economic, military and informational contexts. Therefore, formulating and executing strategy is dynamic and iterative. Unexpected events and crises may also radically change national strategy, requiring the military to operate outside of previous planning assumptions and Defence policy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The National Security Council (NSC) is the main forum for discussing the government’s objectives for national security. The Council’s key purpose is to make sure that ministers consider national security in the round and in a strategic way. The NSC, chaired by the Prime Minister, meets weekly and its members comprise the Secretaries of State for Defence, Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Home Department, International Development, and Energy and Climate Change as well as Chief Secretary to the Treasury and the Minister for Government Policy. Other Cabinet ministers, the Chief of the Defence Staff and Heads of Intelligence Agencies attend as required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Government’s national security priorities are decided using the National Security Strategy (NSS) and by Strategic Defence and Security Reviews (SDSRs), both led by the NSC. The SDSR identifies the means and ways across Government which are needed to deliver the ends described in the NSS. The Government has committed to producing a new NSS and SDSR every five years.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National strategy informs our contribution to multinational activity. To realise policy objectives with other actors to achieve common strategic goals, we must:
• understand the interests and resolve of other actors; and
• influence both decision-making and the division of burden-sharing. 
The process by which objectives are established and resources allocated across an alliance or coalition is more complex than for a national enterprise.
Defence policy
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence policy establishes the ends of military strategy and shapes the structures and capabilities of Defence’s contribution to national objectives within resource and other constraints. UK and Defence interests and objectives must be articulated clearly to provide the baseline for making decisions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence strategy constitutes Defence’s overall contribution to national strategy and is a subset of it. It is a Department of State function, owned by the Secretary of State for Defence. Its delivery is the joint responsibility of the Permanent Under Secretary (PUS) and Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). National strategy articulates national policy objectives and the routes by which government departments, in combination, will deliver them. Defence strategy translates the responsibilities allocated to Defence to more specific outcomes and the outputs required to deliver them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A further function of Defence strategy is to ensure that the UK maintains and sustains credible and capable military forces. Defence strategy directs how Defence will develop over time based on the anticipated requirements of the future operating environment, balanced against the reality of finite resources and the need to prioritise. Defence strategy formally changes through the five-yearly NSS and SDSR but also directs changes to the strategic approach between SDSRs. Examples include, committing the Ministry of Defence to supporting new operations, forging new bilateral or multilateral relationships or by adjusting major equipment programmes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence strategy sits above the interests of individual Services. It is about knitting together corporate strategy (namely, organising and managing Defence resources to generate capability) with political/military and military strategy. To be effective, Defence strategy requires close collaboration across a number of areas of expertise, both civilian and military. This is exemplified in the membership of the Defence Board and the Defence Strategy Group respectively.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Political/military strategy shapes and directs a range of Defence activities, including operations, but focussing on influence, conflict prevention and supporting broader Government interests. Political/military strategy also encompasses shaping and implementing the various individual strategies which direct our broader activities, including the: International Defence Engagement Strategy, Building Stability Overseas Strategy, UK’s Counter-Terrorism Strategy (CONTEST) and Emerging Powers Strategy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Further, Political/military strategy encompasses our multilateral Defence engagement within the international institutions the UK belongs to, including the UN, NATO and the EU. It includes supporting Defence exports and other MOD activities at home and abroad. Leadership on thematic issues across counter-proliferation, climate change, energy security, nuclear deterrence, stabilisation, cyber and space all fall within the political/military strategic space.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military strategy is a subset of Defence strategy. It directs the use of the military instrument where it has been identified by the Government as part of a UK response to a specific challenge. Military strategy is a strategic headquarters function, owned by CDS and led on his behalf by Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Military Strategy and Operations).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Specifically, the aim of military strategy is to ensure coherent and effective strategic planning when using our Armed Forces. Military strategy is inherently joint. It also sits above single-Service interests, tying together military capabilities to deliver an effect that meets the short-term requirement, but is firmly rooted in a clear understanding of the long-term policy ends. Military strategy has a role to play in developing policy through delivering military advice including, ultimately, the advice delivered by CDS to the Prime Minister. It should respond to the requirements asked of it by politicians and policy-makers, but should also proactively offer up options in support of the Government’s ambitions. Importantly, military strategy must, at all times, be rooted in Defence strategy and policy. Operational policy staffs are embedded within the military strategy function to ensure that planning and operational delivery take place within the boundaries defined by policy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The NSS and SDSR inform strategy formulation. The SDSR process is overseen by PUS and CDS, supported by Vice Chief of the Defence Staff. This is closely coordinated with other government departments and includes our contribution to reviewing the National Security Risk Assessment every two years. Each SDSR outlines the main parts of an affordable force structure, which is planned for delivery in ten years time, based on planning assumptions. The SDSR generates a defence strategic direction document, which translates the outcome into long-term planning direction. The interpretation of this direction for the next five years, particularly in terms of allocating resources, is set out in the Defence Plan.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National strategy directs the coordinated use of the three instruments of national power: diplomatic, economic and military. The three instruments of power are underpinned by information.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Diplomacy is about managing international relations to further national interests. The diplomatic instrument of national power assists the UK to achieve its policy objectives through diplomatic means. Successful diplomacy depends upon the power of persuasive negotiation, reinforced by capable and credible hard power (both military and economic). Diplomacy is enhanced by a combination of reputation and integrity, the skilful interplay of the other instruments of power and effective communication. While diplomacy has traditionally been regarded a state-to-state activity, it is evolving to incorporate other opinion-formers, power-brokers and third parties. The diplomatic instrument is in constant use (including during conflict) when the need to influence allies and neutrals, as well as opponents, is as vital as using military force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence diplomacy is using Defence assets to support diplomatic objectives and further Defence interests and is a pillar of the UK’s International Defence Engagement Strategy (2013).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Overseas investment, international flows of capital and trade, and development assistance provide scope for exercising economic influence. The UK can use a range of economic incentives, boycotts, tariffs and sanctions to influence decisions and shape behaviour. The effect of economic measures will be shaped by the economic and political character of those we aim to influence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In some circumstances, military force will support the economic instrument (for example, through embargo operations). Placing military equipment contracts or reforming indigenous military structures in a foreign country may foster other positive economic outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military activities supporting national strategy and objectives can range from deterrence and coercion through to applying force to counter a specific threat. The main strategic objectives of any operation involving Defence will be political in nature – this precludes an exclusively military solution to conflict. The military instrument:
• is most effective when employed with the other instruments to achieve national objectives; and
• is ‘not an independent phenomenon, but the continuation of policy by different means’.
In difficult negotiations with obstructive adversaries, diplomacy might only be successful if backed up by the credible threat of force. The military instrument’s unique contribution is to threaten, or apply, legitimate force to ensure our nation’s security, maintain freedom from foreign oppression and defend national interests. Therefore, the military instrument is as much about influencing minds as physical effects.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military utility relies upon the ability and willingness to deploy forces rapidly and effectively, and then sustain them. Many states are unable to overcome the logistic and command and control difficulties inherent in the deployment and operational direction of a modern, technologically-advanced military force. States with armed forces that lack the means of effectively projecting their power on a global scale may only exert regional influence. Our ability to deploy worldwide is a vital element of the UK’s power in international relations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Applying force, or the credible threat of using it against those seeking to erode security, can help to maintain the integrity and security of the international system and reassures threatened populations and communities. The extent to which the UK can exert such influence depends on maintaining sufficient and capable forces. The UK maintains a military capability comprising both nuclear and conventional forces, at readiness levels consistent with the assessed threat and perceived intentions of potential opponents.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Information underpins all three national instruments of power and enables understanding and decision-making. Information should be regarded as a critical resource and its flow will be contested. Advantage can be gained by managing, in relative terms, the information flow better than your opponent. This is known as information superiority. While information is fundamental to the Government’s approach to crisis management, our national position is that information is not a discrete instrument of power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Disseminating information, through a cross-government information strategy, enables the UK to exert diplomatic, economic and military influence in an effective and integrated way. At the same time, intelligence and information received across government shapes operations planning and execution at all levels. In times of crisis, the information strategy must include a strategic narrative, which outlines why the UK is engaged and what its objectives are. This narrative is crucial to efficiently managing information, as well as influencing a range of audiences and activities in a consistent, coherent manner.

Cyberspace is an operating environment within the information environment. In Defence, cyberspace is the interdependent network of information technology infrastructures, (including the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, as well as embedded processors and controllers) and the data therein within the information environment. As the world is increasingly interconnected with an associated growth in the use of cyberspace, our ability to operate in cyberspace is vital to our national interest and enables our national security, prosperity and way of life. Defence is increasingly dependent upon cyberspace and can expect adversaries to exploit this dependence. The UK government assesses the cyber threats to its interests and mitigates these through resilience measures, awareness and trusted partnerships. Activities in cyberspace are an essential element of our routine business and are fundamental to planning and conducting operations.

<|startoftext|>
Owing to uneven rates of growth and variations in technology, demography and resources, the geostrategic balance of power between states (and groups within states) changes over time. This may confer advantage on one state (or group) or another. States also determine their posture based on the way their elites and populations perceive their status relative to other states within the international community. These factors, as well as a nation’s propensity for security and stability, determine the relative importance afforded to employing its instruments of power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Individually, each instrument of power is limited in terms of its discrete influence and impact. Ideally, they should act together, unified behind a common national goal. How they are employed, in any given situation, requires an understanding of the strategic context and the national policy objectives being sought. To ensure coherence in the pursuit of objectives, strategic communication seeks to synchronise all messages by words, images and actions across the instruments of power and the whole information environment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The instruments of national power are finite and their use must be prioritised and balanced. For Defence, this requires understanding the likely threats. This enables us to allocate resources to deal with both current operations and maintain a contingent capability for the unforeseen.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A key UK policy priority is to prevent conflict or other crises from developing which may affect the UK’s national interests. A crisis marks the point at which events become intensely difficult or dangerous. The term crisis is also used to indicate a period of extreme instability. Effective crisis management comprises:
• the process of preventing, containing or resolving crises before they develop into armed conflict;
• planning for possible escalation; and
• addressing the underlying causes.
This does not imply that all crises can be managed. Their characteristics are likely to change, not least in response to any military or other intervention, and in ways that are not envisaged. Also, the lead-up to a crisis which is resolved peacefully may appear similar to the lead-up to a crisis which escalates into conflict. As it is difficult to predict when conflict will occur, we must be capable of reacting quickly to evolving circumstances.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Relationships between states, between groups and factions within a state, and between state and non-state actors are always competitive and may be classified as those of cooperation, confrontation and conflict.
• Cooperation provides the ideal basis for enduring stability.
• Confrontation arises where differences can no longer be reconciled.
• Conflict results when escalation cannot be prevented or contained, leading to one or other party resorting to violence. A deterioration in relations may be triggered by a crisis, or may itself constitute
one. In reality, the boundaries between cooperation, confrontation and conflict are complex and constantly evolve. Indeed, relationships between states and non-state actors can simultaneously involve elements of cooperation, confrontation and conflict across different areas of interaction. Defence must be capable of operating across this spectrum, conducting military activities to:
• promote mutual cooperation;
• prevent confrontation from escalating into conflict (or at least contain it); and
• through combat operations, set the conditions for conflict resolution.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cooperation enables disputes to be managed, controlled or dissipated rather than ending in conflict. While cooperation may develop between actors who share common, or at least compatible, aims and objectives, it can be established and maintained through a more active approach. Given that domestic and international relations involve some degree of discord, including economic competition, cooperation is underpinned by stability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
When cooperation breaks down, either after a specific event or due to a gradual deterioration in relations, a crisis (possibly including confrontation) may follow. Confrontation is characterised by a clash of wills, where opponents, having failed to reconcile their differences, seek to exert influence over each other. Confrontation may occur between any groups and is not the preserve of state actors.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The root causes of any crisis can only be addressed effectively through diplomatic and economic means, backed when necessary by the credible threat of using a capable armed force. Hence, crisis management, and re-establishing enduring stability, will demand an integrated response.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
If differences cannot be resolved satisfactorily by other means, confrontation can rapidly deteriorate into armed conflict. Conflict is characterised by a resort to violence to gain advantage and achieve desired outcomes. An integral part of crisis management is preventing conflict. This is achieved by containing confrontation and preventing escalation or expansion.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
War is a state of armed conflict between different countries, or different groups within a country. Warfare is the conduct of war. Clausewitz outlines two facets of war:
• its nature, which remains constant under all circumstances; and
• its character, the variable ‘means by which war has to be fought’ which alters according to context.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The nature of war has certain enduring features.
• The decision to wage war is an act or expression of policy. The measure of its success is the extent to which belligerents deem its political outcomes to be favourable.
• War is undertaken to maintain a position of advantage, establish a more advantageous situation, or influence the attitudes or behaviour of another party.
• Belligerent opponents may employ all the military and non-military ways and means available to them, to seek success.
• Warfare reflects, among other things, the culture and society of belligerents and other actors.
• Warfare is an inherently unpredictable, often chaotic, human activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
An operation is defined as: a sequence of coordinated actions with a defined purpose. A campaign comprises one or more operations that integrate using the instruments of power to achieve a strategic goal.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The levels of warfare provide a framework within which to rationalise and categorise military activity. This framework, depicted at Figure 1.1, also clarifies the interrelationships between the various levels, although these should not be seen as discrete, as the levels often overlap. The framework of strategic, operational and tactical levels recognises the inevitable compression and blurring between them and reflects their dynamic interrelationship and non-linear interaction. The relationship between what is tactical, operational and strategic is both fluid and contextual. Tactical gains and losses may have far greater strategic effects than that which is immediately obvious.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Information resources enable accurate and timely situational awareness, and understanding. However, information flows can compress the levels of warfare, especially at the operational level, such that reported events and activities, true and false, may have immediate impact at the strategic level. At the same time, this interconnected and information-rich environment invites intervention by strategic- level political and military leaders seeking to influence tactical-level activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The strategic level of warfare is the level at which national resources are allocated to achieve the government’s policy goals (set against a backdrop of both national and international imperatives). Achieving these goals usually requires
a combination of military force, diplomacy and economic measures, as well as collaboration with other nations’ governments and armed forces and other international organisations and agencies. Strategic success requires foresight, patience, endurance, tenacity and the ability to adapt to changing circumstances.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The operational level of warfare is the level at which operations are planned, conducted and sustained, to contribute to achieving national strategic aims, as well as synchronising action, within theatres or areas of operation. The operational level provides the bridge between the strategic and tactical levels.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In a national context, the operational level is the responsibility of the Joint Commander, acting with the theatre-level Joint Force Commander (JFC) In a multinational setting, the UK national contingent commander will be responsible for integrating the national contribution into the overall force. The national contingent commander:
• advises and influences the deployed multinational force commander; • applies national policies and caveats; and
• owns the in-theatre responsibility for national activities. The scale of the operational level is not pre-defined: it should assume a size and shape commensurate with the requirements of the operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The tactical level of warfare is the level at which formations, units and individuals ultimately confront an opponent or situation within the joint operations area. The tactical level employs maritime; land; air and space; and special operations forces to deliver a range of effects that together contribute to success on operations. This is the level at which engagements are fought in direct contact with an opponent. In a joint operation, the tactical level normally involves component commanders operating directly to the JFC, although some actions and planning will overlap with the operational level. Under the JFC’s direction, tactical units execute actions to create the required effects in a joint, multinational and multi- agency context, thereby setting the conditions for success.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
While these levels exist formally within the military, the same distinctions are not made within the diplomatic and economic instruments. There are, however, broadly similar levels of decision-making and planning, if only for allocating resources and manpower. To ensure a unified, integrated approach to crisis resolution, it is vital that interaction and cooperation between those planning and coordinating diplomatic, military and economic activities take place at every level.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We must retain our fighting power and warfighting excellence – both enable our credibility and utility. When required, we must be able to fight and win to defend our country and our Overseas Territories from external aggression.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fighting power defines our ability to fight, and comprises a:
• conceptual component (the thought process);
• moral component (the ability to get people to fight); and
• physical component (the means to fight).
Figure 2.1 outlines the three components of fighting power – none can claim precedence and each mutually supports and informs the other.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Conflict is competitive and adversarial. Belligerents seek to diminish or undermine the fighting power of their opponents while safeguarding their own. Achieving relative superiority is critical in successful military operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fighting power is built upon human capability. Human capability is the collective impact that people have on an enterprise. Human capability underpins Defence’s professionalism, and comprises the valuable skills, knowledge and experience possessed by our people, including those contractors and partners with whom we operate; it provides the decisive edge. Generating human capability requires a whole force approach, in which the right mix of people from regular and reserve forces, the Civil Service and contractors are made capable and motivated.
Human factors
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fighting power may be enhanced by applying scientific expertise relating to the social, psychological and behavioural aspects of human behaviour. Understanding group dynamics and people’s motivations supports assessments of likely behaviour in complex situations.
Context
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fighting power must be considered in context.
a. The character of the situation. Fighting power must be applied in a way that best suits the prevailing situation and conditions. This also includes being aware of political, resource or legal constraints.
b. The environment. Environmental factors will affect the range of options available to commanders and shape military activities. The topography, climate and distribution of the urban, agricultural and industrial landscapes each present threats and opportunities. Societal aspects and the cultural environment will also have an impact on how we apply fighting power and not always in ways that could be immediately obvious. We must be mentally and physically conditioned to operate in the environments we fight in. A force optimised to fight in one scenario may be ill-equipped to operate elsewhere.
c. The opponent. Protecting UK interests may require using force against a wide array of potential opponents, both state and non-state. In some instances, the opponent may have outright numerical superiority. In others, they may negate our greater mass by using asymmetric tactics or by operating in difficult environments, such as large cities. In either case, success will depend on the quality of our fighting power and the skill with which we apply it. Yet, even when our Armed Forces have numerical and qualitative superiority, high morale and strong resolve may allow an opponent to absorb considerable losses.
d. Allies, partners and other agencies. Interoperability is necessary to employ military capability across a coalition force, while role specialisation and burden sharing may promote efficiency. Cooperation and collaboration between the diplomatic, military and economic instruments, as part of an integrated approach, will also need us to interact and coordinate with other agencies. This may further shape the utility of certain aspects of our fighting power, not least interpreting doctrine to accommodate non-military actors and their cultures, practices and procedures. However, role specialisation may also leave a nation’s forces incapable of undertaking certain operations independently. Interoperability may be expensive to achieve and sustain and may also require us to operate to a common standard.
e. Culture and history. Understanding the cultural and historical features of a situation, and incorporating that into planning and training, will give us key insights into how we can best apply fighting power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The likelihood of success on operations is shaped by:
• coherently applying fighting power against an opponent;
• the uncertainties induced by unpredictable or unpredicted events;
• the interplay of chance; and
• the vagaries of human nature.
When assessing the situation, our commanders must understand the context in which they are applying fighting power. Informed decisions can then be made which will shape the situation. Commanders should aim to apply their strengths against an opponent’s vulnerabilities (while protecting their own comparative weakness).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The conceptual component provides a framework of thinking within which military personnel can develop understanding about both their profession and the activities that they may have to undertake. The conceptual component has relevance at all levels of warfare. The aim of the conceptual component is to:
• provide the intellectual basis for our Armed Forces;
• theoretically justify providing and employing our Armed Forces; and
• preserve and take forward corporate memory, experience and knowledge.
In doing so, the conceptual component reflects accumulated experience, improvements to existing practice (gained through lessons and experimentation) and analysis of the future security environment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The conceptual component provides commanders with the ability to understand the context within which they operate and serves as the foundation upon which creativity, ingenuity and initiative may be exercised in complex situations. The conceptual component comprises three elements: the principles of war; doctrine; and conceptual innovation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The principles of war inform and guide the way in which we apply military power. They are not an exhaustive list, nor need commanders to rigidly follow them. Underpinned by understanding, mission command and the manoeuvrist approach, they represent enduring principles, whose expression and emphasis change in relation to context. The UK’s principles of war are listed on page 30 and 31.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mission command. The UK’s philosophy of mission command has four enduring tenets:
• timely decision-making;
• thorough understanding of a superior commander’s intent;
• clear responsibility on the part of subordinates to fulfil intent; and
• determination to take the plan through to a successful conclusion.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The fundamental guiding principle is the absolute responsibility to act, or to decide not to act, within the framework of a superior commander’s intent. This approach requires a style of command that promotes decentralised command, freedom and speed of action and initiative, but which is responsive to superior direction when subordinates overreach themselves.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In practical terms, mission command has five essential elements:
• commanders must ensure that their subordinates understand their intent, their own contributions and the context within which they are to act;
• commanders should exercise a minimum of control over their subordinates, consistent with their experience and ability, while retaining responsibility for their actions;
• subordinates are told what effect they are to achieve and why;
• subordinates are allocated sufficient resources to carry out their missions; and
• subordinates decide for themselves how best to achieve their superior’s intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mission command assists subordinates to understand their commander’s intent and their place within their plan. This enables them to execute activity with the maximum freedom of action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Manoeuvrist approach. The manoeuvrist approach to operations applies strength against identified vulnerabilities, including predominately indirect ways and means of targeting the intellectual and moral component of an opponent’s fighting power. Significant features are momentum, tempo, and agility which, in combination, aim to achieve shock and surprise.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
While the UK’s principles of war are consistent with the principles of operations applied by NATO, there are some differences. Allied Joint Publication (AJP) 01, Allied Joint Doctrine lists the principles of Allied joint and multinational operations. Annex 2A compares the UK’s principles of war with NATO’s principles of operations.
Doctrine
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Except where there is a specific need for national doctrine, the UK will adopt and employ NATO doctrine, where necessary with caveats or amplification to reflect our national position. UK doctrine comprises three broad areas.
• Joint doctrine. The joint doctrine architecture of publications, headed by JDP 0-01, UK Defence Doctrine, comprises NATO and national doctrine publications covering all aspects of military operations.
• Higher-level environmental doctrine. Doctrine publications for maritime, land, air and space, special forces and cyber provide the necessary familiarity and broad basis of understanding for joint and component commanders, formations and units to operate effectively across environmental boundaries.
• Joint tactical doctrine. Joint tactics, techniques and procedures (JTTPs) and Allied Tactical Publications (ATPs) are prescriptive (often detailed) instructions that encapsulate best practice as established on operations and in training.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
To meet government policy needs and develop future Defence capabilities, the UK maintains a progressive programme of intellectual and academic engagement, education and experimentation. Understanding extant doctrine contributes directly to the conceptual component. The conceptual component is also updated by conceptual innovation, capturing how our thinking changes over time in response to new technologies, structures and challenges.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Warfare is a human activity and the moral component exerts a decisive psychological influence, both individually and collectively. While morals (principles of right and wrong) is one aspect which enhances cohesion and morale (a sense of confidence and well-being) is another which promotes courage and commitment, the moral component is considerably broader.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The moral component of fighting power is about getting people to fight. The moral component comprises three interrelated functions:
• moral cohesion (prepared to fight);
• motivation (enthused to fight); and
• leadership (inspired to fight).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Moral cohesion underpins the moral courage to fight and to keep on fighting; moral integrity supports cohesion. Cohesion occurs when individuals work together, share tasks and rewards, and provide mutual support to achieve a common aim. Moral cohesion is built on shared experiences, a common sense of worth, appropriate discipline and collective identity and:
• is sustained by shared common values and standards; and
• embodies genuine and deep comradeship that endures even as the experience of violence and fear of death and injury begin to pervade an individual’s conscious and subconscious.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A feeling of pride and mutual loyalty uniting the members of a group, an esprit de corps, reinforces unit identity and cements moral cohesion. Commanders should consider three key aspects.
a. Professional ethos. An exemplary professional ethos, combined with an appealing cultural identity and strong military reputation, is a powerful moral force in its own right. The ethos of each Service is derived from a number of identifiable and intangible qualities that promote a fighting spirit and a determination to succeed, whatever the conditions. These qualities include:
• physical and moral courage;
• selfless commitment;
• loyalty;
• mental agility;
• initiative;
• stamina;
• adaptability; and
• teamwork.
A willingness to face danger is strengthened by emotional links and commitment to comrades, units and the country.
b. Self-esteem. Through membership of our Armed Forces, military personnel derive significant self-esteem and satisfaction with life. Self- esteem is derived from a sense of belonging to a highly-capable, professional organisation.
c. Tradition. Team cohesion is strengthened by a sense of heritage, infused by professional reputation and fostered through shared identity. Tradition and custom, manifested in ceremonies, uniforms, museums and Service distinctions, are critical ingredients in promoting and sustaining an esprit de corps. The commitment to prevail on operations, whatever the personal cost, is reinforced by an established and proven national and Service reputation for excellence and a consciousness of being part of that tradition.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Moral integrity provides the foundations upon which both cohesion and motivation are built and requires individuals to have an understanding of right and wrong. Instilled through education and training, moral integrity is reinforced by aligning our people’s values with the values and standards of our Armed Forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As an organisation that is democratically accountable and responsible to the society we represent, the moral legitimacy of our Armed Forces depends upon the individual and collective adherence to ethical principles. We must all promote and maintain the highest legal and ethical standards. Commanders are responsible for the moral integrity of their units and units reflect the attitudes of their commanders.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Motivation is a product of training, confidence in equipment, leadership, management, reward, discipline and mutual respect. Motivation requires an understanding of both what is going on and what is required. Motivation and high morale (the will to fight and a confidence in succeeding) are interdependent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Motivation is susceptible to external influences, including public opinion. The will to fight is substantially reinforced and sustained by the belief that the nation supports us; therefore, the media’s contribution is important. Positive reporting reassures Service personnel that they enjoy national support and publicly recognises their personal contribution to an arduous, and often dangerous, endeavour (without compromising operational security). Equally, adverse media activity can erode morale.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Motivation is also underpinned by the knowledge that we enjoy a reputation that is built on an honest assessment of what is deliverable – and then delivering it. Therefore, Defence must be both clear on what it can achieve and resolute in executing military power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Leadership is characterised by projecting personality and purpose to influence subordinates and other key stakeholders (such as contractors) to prevail in demanding circumstances. There is no definitive style of leader and no prescription for leadership. Leadership is not the preserve of senior officers – decisive leadership must be practised at every level. The exercise of leadership is related to individual and group dynamics and the context within which assigned missions and tasks have to be achieved. While natural leaders are rare, training and experience can develop latent potential. Leaders should consider the following:
• leadership is a variable combination of example, persuasion and compulsion;
• effective leaders must demonstrate strength of character, judgement, initiative and professionalism, and use these to address problems and maximise opportunities;
• to gain the respect and commitment of their subordinates, leaders must demonstrate professional competence, fair discipline and moral courage;
• leaders should engender in their subordinates the confidence that breeds initiative and the acceptance of risk and responsibility;
• in the face of adversity, leaders must demonstrate courage and contain their own fear;
• leaders must not confuse activity with progress;
• calm, confident leadership, enhanced by clear communications, is vital to the success of operations and maintaining morale;
• leadership is based on presence and example;
• relationships should be built, and maintained, with subordinate formations, units and individuals, including contractors and partners;
• managing personnel is no substitute for leadership, but vitally supports it;
• leadership over distance, within large spans of command, decentralised networks, or Allied and joint structures, is challenging; and
• subordinates’ perceptions of their leaders are based on their reputation, demonstration of competence, personal example and authority. Together, effective leadership and sound management establish and sustain motivation and inspire confidence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A warfighting ethos, as distinct from a purely professional one, continues to be fundamental to all those in our Armed Forces. A warfighting ethos:
• comprises initiative, courage and determination;
• enables success in the most demanding circumstances;
• embodies the ideals and duties of military service; and
• unifies those who serve in our Armed Forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Notwithstanding the proportion of our careers engaged in duties other than warfighting, it is essential that we develop and retain the physical and moral fortitude to fight when called upon to do so. Not only must we all accept the legal right and duty to apply lethal force, we also accept a potentially unlimited liability to lay down our lives in the service of the nation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Armed conflict is a destructive business characterised by uncertainty, friction and chaos. Fear is commonplace, even when our minds have been conditioned to cope with its challenges. Our best counters to fear are: courage and leadership, coupled with unit cohesion and discipline. We should regularly practise and test all of these counter actions during training.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Armed Forces Covenant is an enduring covenant between UK citizens, Her Majesty’s Government and all those who serve, or have served, in our Armed Forces. The Covenant recognises the extra demands of service life and the sacrifices made in defending our nation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We are bound by service. The nature of service is inherently unequal in that we may have to contribute more than we receive. We may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice in the service of our country. In putting the needs of the UK, our Service and others before ourselves, we forego some of the rights and freedoms enjoyed by civilians.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Covenant outlines a framework for how our Armed Forces community can expect to be treated by the nation and codifies the obligations that the different parties to the Covenant owe to each other. However, the obligations are not conditional. Our duty to serve is never dependent on the other elements of the Covenant being met.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The physical component of fighting power provides the means to fight. The physical component consists of manpower, training, collective performance, equipment and sustainability, at readiness.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As technological and equipment superiority is never guaranteed, Defence invests in its people to provide the decisive edge. The term people includes Service personnel, both regular and reserve, as well as MOD-employed civilians and contracted personnel. It is essential that we invest in our people to ensure there are sufficient numbers who are capable and motivated. A sustainable workforce demands investment in recruiting, developing and retaining high-quality personnel.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Human capability should be regarded as a key resource and should be fully integrated into Defence planning. Rather than simply relying on superior fire power and technical capabilities, our commanders must seek out, develop and exploit human qualities such as effective thinking, resilience, adaptability and empathy to build the agility which Defence will need in the future operating environment. Commanders should also champion innovative practice.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
To condition military recruits for the hardship and challenges of operations, each undergoes a rigorous selection and initial training process. Collective training shapes them into contributing team members. Further professional development then maintains the requisite skills balance within the overall force structure. Despite the attractions and economies of simulation, an element of live training is necessary to prepare personnel for the reality of combat. We must make sure that we match our training to the complexities of likely operating environments.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Collective performance is characterised by the high levels of cohesion, confidence and proficiency achieved by units and formations that have trained or operated together. Collective performance is optimised when it integrates partners and contractors. Where time and resources allow, this should be achieved by individual Services to prepare their respective force elements for joint activity. Thereafter, collective performance should focus on contributing to joint and multinational operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A credible fighting force depends upon sufficient and effective equipment, optimised and scaled according to likely challenges. Our equipment should match the envisaged scale and intensity of use and easily accommodate human, system and platform requirements.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Projecting and employing a force demands a balanced and sustainable equipment capability programme. Driven by both strategic need and conceptual innovation, our equipment acquisition programme should be underpinned by both sustainable and robust manufacture and supply, as well as flexible through-life support. While technology may provide an advantage over an opponent, experience has shown that an over-reliance on technology (especially when it is unproven), at the expense of a proven, human-based fighting culture, may increase risk.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Sustainability is an essential element to give us credible and effective fighting power. It is enabled by combining:
• logistics;
• personnel and administrative force structures;
• training and equipment;
• infrastructure; and
• communications and information management.
Logistics links the strategic base (including infrastructure, stock and industrial capacity) with deployed forces. Operational tempo will only be as fast as available logistics capacity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK holds forces at varying states of readiness consistent with the assessed risks and threats. Readiness postures:
• balance the time needed for force generation, preparation and deployment, with available resources;
• comprise a combination of manpower, equipment availability, sustainability and collective performance;
• indicate the time within which a unit or formation can be made ready to perform tasks; and
• can contribute to deterrence by demonstrating our preparedness and resolve.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK seeks to maintain sufficient military capability to deal with likely crises and conflicts that could threaten its national interests. However, an emerging crisis (from an unforeseen situation or against an unexpected opponent) may require new capabilities or render obsolete those currently held. Therefore, the UK generates and maintains fighting power that, subject to adequate resourcing:
• is broadly balanced and able to deal with a variety of possible scenarios;
• is agile enough to adapt as challenges emerge; and
• can adopt the latest technology and systems.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fighting power is generated to produce military forces that are capable of succeeding on operations. There is an important, although not an absolute, distinction between having fighting power and generating it. Collective training, for example, provides no capability itself; it is the resulting collective performance that contributes to the physical component. Conceptual innovation provides the basis for future capability development, as well as enhancing our understanding of the likely context within which forces may have to operate.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Generating fighting power has two implications.
a. Generating fighting power provides the focus for all non-operational activity across Defence. On operations, certain aspects of fighting power such as morale may be enhanced, while others such as equipment may become depleted. A balance should be struck from the strategic through to the tactical levels, between generating fighting power to achieve immediate objectives (especially at high tempo over prolonged periods) and efforts to sustain and generate fighting power for the future. This includes maintaining our capability to deal with contingencies.
b. Generating fighting power rests upon supporting foundations. While not contributing directly to operational capability, these are essential to ensure that fighting power can be provided and sustained. A secure home base with adequate technical and domestic accommodation is one tangible aspect of this supporting foundation; providing appropriate health, welfare and administration for our people are others. Just as today’s fighting power is the product of past investment, so current investment will determine the extent of fighting power available in the future.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A commander’s primary responsibility is to orchestrate fighting power, balancing the ways and means to achieve objectives to obtain favourable outcomes (the ends). Their focus must be on effectively coordinating the components of fighting power to:
• optimise their employment throughout the spectrum of current operational requirements; and
• preserve their strength and agility for future use.
Coordinating and synchronising activity is a complex task and will only deliver agility, tempo and unity of effort when planned and conducted by commanders and staffs who are experienced, and have exercised and rehearsed together.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Command and control, through effective organisations and structures, synchronises activity. Complex operations demand a command and control philosophy that does not rely upon precise control, but is able to function despite uncertainty, disorder and adversity. Command and control enables a commander to identify and manage risk and exploit opportunity, while converting intent into effect. Where control measures are established, these have a role in reducing the complementary need for direct command. Where control measures are ambiguous, weak or absent, more command is required. Command and control systems must have the agility to react to evolving situations. In any environment, the simplest, yet most adaptable system, is best.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Analysing information and intelligence establishes and maintains situational understanding and supports better decision-making. Networked capabilities can enable effective decision-making and help to synchronise activity. However, near-real time information flows, in ever-increasing volumes and to wider audiences, must be managed to allow information to be exploited. Effective information management ensures that data does not inhibit or overload the commander’s decision-making capacity; this supports information superiority. To process the significant amount of information and data that operations both demand and generate, commanders must demonstrate (and promote) both agile thought and decision-making skills.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Generating and orchestrating fighting power demands collaboration and coordination. We need to invest early and understand the broad range of our stakeholders. Working together comprises: joint activity between the three single Services; an integrated approach across government; and a multinational perspective.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The integrated approach is underpinned by our people – regular and reserve service personnel, MOD civil servants, contractors and other civilians. Working together, these different groups form the ‘whole force’ which delivers Defence outputs. Under the whole force approach, Defence places human capability at the heart of its decision-making and ensures that Defence outputs are delivered by the right mix of capable and motivated people now and in the future, and that people are managed as a strategic resource.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
UK military operations are executed through joint action, a term used to describe deliberately using and orchestrating military capabilities and activities to realise specific physical and/or psychological effects. Joint action coordinates and synchronises:
• fires (physical or virtual means to realise primarily physical effects);
• information activities (including regional and key leader engagement);
• manoeuvre (used to gain advantage in time and space); and
• outreach (including stabilisation, support to governance and capacity
building).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The joint approach describes activities, operations and organisations in which elements of a least two Services participate. The Royal Navy, British Army and Royal Air Force each own unique specialist capabilities that are built on experience, training and culture. These maximise the contribution of fighting power to the maritime, land, air and space environments. Jointery needs active investment. Commanders need to invest people, time and resources to develop joint practitioners.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Notions (and expectations) of jointery are often misunderstood. While resource pressures will demand maximum effect from limited means, joint activity must be planned carefully to ensure efficiency. Joint activity is not a means to an end in
itself, and it must plan, sequence and execute activity to achieve a desired end-state. Neither should the notion of jointery degrade single-Service ethos. Each cherish hard-won traditions, customs and cultures.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The benefits of working closely together are clear. Joint activity comprises fusing capabilities to deliver more than the sum of parts. For example, joint enablers comprising cross-cutting capabilities, functions and organisations (such as medical services, training and education, intelligence and cyber) offer operational and resource efficiencies. Joint doctrine offers the operational glue to bind the activities of the Services.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The military instrument often plays a decisive role in providing or building a secure environment. However, crisis management cannot succeed without active cross-government and multi-agency cooperation. Effective inter-agency relationships need more than simply harmonising processes. Relationships work better where people value the different cultures involved and show patience and understanding when required. Relationships are also enabled by regular and routine interaction.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In a national context, an integrated approach requires clear national objectives, strong political leadership and collaboration across departments to make sure ensure that the UK’s national power is coherently applied. A national approach will usually be framed within a broader multinational response, involving many actors including allies, international organisations and non-governmental organisations. As nations and organisations may have competing aims and agendas, achieving coherence in a multinational context is likely to be more challenging than it is in a national context.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In complex multi-agency situations, involving civilian organisations and possibly a civilian political head of mission, military activity may only address part of the desired outcome. While it is unlikely that absolute consistency will be achieved between civilian and military activities, commanders are to both promote, and support, an integrated approach. An integrated approach comprises four guiding principles.
a. Proactive engagement between all entities, ideally ahead of a crisis, enables a more cohesive response to complex situations. To increase the time available for reaction, a shared approach to collecting and interpreting crisis indicators is necessary.
b. Shared understanding brings distinct professional, technical and cultural disciplines together, albeit with unique values and perceptions. Understanding helps to meld different capabilities, gives extra perspectives and may enhance resilience. A shared understanding can only be built between crises through cooperative working practices, liaison and education.
c. Outcome-based thinking requires all participants to base their thinking on the outcomes required to deliver a favourable situation. Cohesion and coherence, delivered by good leadership, will help all entities to work towards agreed outcome-based objectives that are consistent with the national strategic aims.
d. Collaborative working enhances the trust that underpins productive relationships. Integrated information management, infrastructure and connectivity, supporting common working practices, generate a more- collaborative ethos.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
An integrated approach requires a culture of collaboration and cooperation, and structures developed to enable shared understanding. This approach fosters collective intent and output-focused objectives – and both enable mutually- supporting action. Where it is not possible to integrate or synchronise activity, commanders must aim to de-conflict execution.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although the UK may be required to act alone, in most cases our Armed Forces are likely to operate in partnership. This may be as the lead or as a contributing nation in a NATO operation, with other established allies and partners, or as part of an ad hoc coalition. The aim of most multinational responses will be set out as a UN Security Council Resolution or as part of a ceasefire or treaty settlement. Before any national commitment to participate can be made, diplomatic engagement is required to formulate both the multinational aim and the character of the multinational response.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Just as individual Services bring different attributes and limitations to joint operations, allies and coalition partners will do the same on multinational operations. Understanding other nations’ military capabilities and the ability to merge these into a cohesive force, underpins the conduct of multinational military operations. Our ability to operate with other nations requires flexibility and interoperability. However, working together, in either an integrated or multinational capacity, may confer or generate extra responsibilities for communication and de-confliction. Multinational operations may also generate extra force protection and sustainment requirements.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
When working together, good ‘followership’ is as vital as strong leadership. Military commanders must recognise and promote the benefits of cooperation to achieve unity of purpose, while not necessarily enjoying unity of command. Where a common approach may not be possible owing to national and organisational sensitivities, commanders should seek as inclusive an approach as possible. Effective collaboration requires flexibility, openness and sensitivity towards all stakeholders. For more information on international collaboration see Annex 2B.
Command
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Command embraces authority, responsibility and accountability. Effective command relies upon timely, accurate and effective decision-making and is underpinned by:
• leadership, requiring varying amounts of regulation, delegation, inspiration and coercion; and
• coordinating activity, through processes and structures, that enable a commander to manage risk, exploit opportunity and achieve his aim.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
When using force, our Armed Forces are subject to national and international law. Their objectives and conduct are subject to democratic parliamentary control which is exercised on its behalf by the Executive. Applying fighting power will be limited to that which is necessary to achieve the desired end-state.
Campaign authority
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Campaign authority is the authority established by international forces, agencies and organisations within a given situation. Campaign authority comprises four interdependent factors:
• the perceived legitimacy of the mandate;
• the perceived legitimacy of the manner in which those exercising that mandate conduct themselves both individually and collectively;
• the extent to which factions, local populations and others consent to, comply with, or resist the authority of those executing the mandate; and
• the extent to which the expectations of factions, local populations and others are managed, or met, by those executing the mandate.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Crisis management activities should be both legal and purposeful. They should also be, and be perceived to be, legitimate, acceptable and appropriate in a broader sense. Campaign authority derives from confidence that the appropriate and legitimate measures are employed by those intervening in a crisis. This helps to maintain support from those that shape opinion, share power and grant consent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Creating and maintaining campaign authority depends upon continuously assessing the effects and consequences of the activities undertaken. To influence decisions and opinions, which reinforce campaign authority, an effective information strategy, coordinated across all national and international partners in support of the relevant strategic aim and associated objectives, is required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Legitimacy encompasses the legal, moral, political, diplomatic and ethical propriety of the conduct of military forces. As the justification for using force, and the manner in which it is applied, legitimacy has both collective and individual aspects, both of which directly affects the utility of force. Legitimacy is based upon both subjective considerations, such as the values, beliefs and opinions of a variety of audiences (at home and overseas), and demonstrable, objective legality.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Maintaining legitimacy is crucial. It bolsters morale and promotes cohesion, both within a force and between coalition partners and confers both freedom to act and constraints on military activity. Perceptions of legitimacy are unlikely to be universal or unequivocal and may be shaped by many factors, including the media.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Once military forces are committed, the perception of the manner in which they conduct themselves is an essential element of overall campaign authority. Maintaining legitimacy depends on a variety of issues, such as a consistently reputable behaviour, moral and ethical considerations, and the prospects of a successful outcome.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence must operate within a legal framework, defined by applicable national and international law. Observing the rule of law is fundamental to our warfighting ethos and maintaining campaign authority. Legal aspects of UK Defence are detailed at Annex 2C.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Ethical and moral considerations underpin the law and the administration of justice, and are also reflected in operational decision-making and military conduct. Commanders are accountable for their actions and the actions of those under their command. Commanders are duty-bound to ensure that the highest moral and ethical standards are maintained by their subordinates and can achieve this through a robust ethos, personal example, training and education.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Service personnel will be exposed to the realities and complexities of warfare. They will face opponents with different moral, ethical and legal boundaries and perspectives, while themselves operating under intense scrutiny. The House of Commons Defence Select Committee, domestic law, humanitarian organisations, non-governmental organisations and the media continuously monitor our activities in relation to their moral and ethical impact.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The trend towards transparency and greater regulation of Defence activities reflects the expectations of the society we serve and whose values we reflect. If we are to maintain campaign authority, then we must respect the morals and ethics of our own culture. Moreover, while never compromising our own moral standards, we must respect local traditions, customs and practices and pay appropriate attention to the needs of minority or otherwise vulnerable groups, such as women, children and ethnic minorities. Our challenge is to ensure that society’s expectations of greater legal and ethical regulation are balanced against the imperatives of operational effectiveness.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Political direction, and operational
and legal provisions for using force, are detailed in JSP 398, United Kingdom Rules of Engagement. We must also respect
and comply with the Law of Armed Conflict. Rules of engagement are not a comprehensive statement of either the law or policy, although they take account of both. The rules of engagement:
• ensure that military personnel activities remain within the law and are consistent with government policy;
• define what we can legally do and not do; and
• reflect the operational context.
While rules of engagement may limit activity, they do not limit the legal right to act in self-defence, where such activity is both reasonable and necessary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Armed conflict must contribute towards setting the conditions for a political end-state. The way in which we conduct armed conflict, and the dynamic nature of context, means that political constraints and freedoms are a constant reality. Political decisions that affect using force include those that:
• place limitations on objectives and targets;
• delineate the theatre of operations and manpower limits;
• restrict the types of weapons used; and
• aim to avoid escalation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UN is the mainstay of the international system and the influence gained by the UK’s permanent membership of the UN Security Council is central to the UK’s foreign policy. The UN Security Council usually provides the mandate for multinational military operations. Such operations can play a vital role in conflict prevention and post-conflict stabilisation and in alleviating humanitarian crises or human rights abuse. The UN works in close cooperation with other organisations, such as NATO and the EU.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
NATO is the cornerstone of transatlantic defence and security and has been central to Europe’s stability since 1949. NATO’s core role remains the commitment to safeguarding the freedom and security of its members by political and military means. NATO has a global role in crisis management and stabilisation and can respond to threats wherever they occur. Intervention may include military assistance to disaster relief operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As a founder member of the Alliance, the UK plays a full part in NATO with a range of permanent commitments and the ability to assign further capability in times of crisis. The UK also supports NATO standardisation of doctrine, technology and logistics, to promote interoperability between member nations. Since the end of the Cold War, NATO members have committed to transforming the Alliance in response to emerging security challenges and deploying its force to deal with these threats. This has led to creating a flexible, deployable, interoperable and sustainable NATO Response Force comprising maritime, land and air and space elements. Members have also agreed to improve individual contributions to NATO in key areas, such as strategic air and sealift.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within its borders, the EU is involved in a range of economic, social, environmental and other activities. The EU also has a broad external agenda, which encompasses cooperation on issues such as international crime, terrorism, economic development and trade. The EU is a leading political player on the world stage through its Common Foreign and Security Policy and plays an important complementary role to NATO in enhancing security and stability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The EU has agreed on a European Security and Defence Policy in support of its Common Foreign and Security Policy, to ensure that it has the tools to undertake a more comprehensive role in both military and civilian international crisis management. The European Security and Defence Policy supplements other EU external instruments, such as aid and trade measures, and offers the international community a further option when considering how to respond to global crises. The EU Battlegroup initiative, for example, has evolved to provide capable forces held at high readiness that can be called on by the UN and EU. Members of the EU do not, however, currently share a NATO-style commitment to collective action or defence. Committing national forces to an EU operation remains a sovereign decision for each contributing nation. The EU’s ambition, in terms of military activity, is summarised in the Petersburg Tasks, described in Article 17 of the Treaty on European Union (namely humanitarian and rescue tasks, peacekeeping tasks, and tasks of combat forces in crisis management, including peace enforcement).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe has 55 member states, of equal status, covering the whole of Europe and Central Asia, as well as the USA and Canada. The organisation addresses security across the region in three dimensions: political-military; economic/environmental; and human (including promoting human rights and democratic institutions).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Through the Vienna Document, the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe members committed themselves to an extensive set of confidence and security building measures including:
• annually exchanging military information;
• mechanisms for consulting and cooperating on unusual military activity or
other hazardous incidents (with a view to crisis management);
• military contacts and cooperation;
• prior notification and observing military activities above agreed thresholds;
• establishing verification and inspection mechanisms; and
• establishing a network of direct electronic communications.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UN Charter requires that all member states refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of any other state. However, this does not restrict the inherent right of a state to take action in self-defence in response to an armed attack. Further, it may also be lawful to use offensive force in another state’s territory (without its consent) in certain circumstances – under a Chapter VII UN Security Council Resolution – or to prevent an overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe.
a. National (or State) self-defence. States have an inherent right of individual or collective self-defence if an armed attack occurs, until the Security Council has taken measures necessary to restore international peace and security. Self- defence includes protecting a state’s own territorial integrity and may include evacuating its nationals from another state, which is unable or unwilling to provide that protection.
b. UN Security Council authorisation. Under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, the Security Council may determine that there is a threat to peace, a breach of the peace or an act of aggression. The Security Council may then recommend targeted measures to maintain or restore international peace and security, such as economic sanctions. If required, it may authorise the use of all necessary measures to restore stability and security, which may include the use of force. Security Council authorisations can be granted to regional organisations, such as NATO, as well as to individual member states.
c. Intervention to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe. UK policy is that a limited use of force may be justifiable without the UN Security Council’s express authorisation where that is the only means to avert an immediate and overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe. Such cases are likely to be exceptional and it should be noted that not all nations share this policy stance. Intervention will depend on an objective assessment of the factual circumstances at the time.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National legislation permits UK Armed Forces to be deployed to support the civil authorities. Such support by the MOD and UK Armed Forces – military aid to the civil authorities (MACA) – should always be at the request of those authorities and requires the authorisation of the Defence Council and Defence Ministers. Support to the civil authorities does not usually require additional powers under legislation dealing with emergencies. Therefore, the Service personnel’s conduct is routinely governed by domestic law permitting the use of force in self-defence, to prevent crime or enable the arrest of others in certain circumstances.
Conducting military operations
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Complying with the underpinning principles of the Law of Armed Conflict– distinction, proportionality, military necessity and humanity – in military operations ensures that due account is taken of the wider ethical considerations from which the law is derived. A combination of domestic and international legal considerations also provides the legal basis for regulating the manner in which military operations overseas are conducted. The Armed Forces Act 2006, subjects Service personnel and their commanders to the criminal law of England and Wales for any criminal conduct committed by them when deployed overseas, as well as being liable for the commission of Service disciplinary offences. Service personnel are also subject to international humanitarian law, encompassing war crimes and other grave breaches of international humanitarian law which have been brought into UK domestic law by Act of Parliament.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
International humanitarian law regulates the planning and conduct of military operations in international armed conflicts, hostilities in which states act under UN Security Council authority and some internal armed conflicts. Different rules apply to each situation. On multinational operations, other nations’ forces partners may not all be subject to the same legal framework – their applicable domestic laws, for example, are likely to be different. Military activities and Service personnel’s conduct overseas are usually subject to the domestic law of the host nation – for example, concerning traffic safety and the criminal law. The host nation may, via a memorandum of understanding or a status of forces agreement with the UK, recognise that both their law and UK law applies to UK personnel in their country.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
By integrating the national instruments of power (diplomatic, economic and military – all underpinned by information) the government seeks to influence, through a range of activities, to prevent conflict, protect its legitimate interests and shape a stable world. The UK resides and trades in an increasingly globalised, competitive context. Therefore, maintaining the UK’s security and prosperity is a negotiated and contested process. Threats will appear when they are least expected, often without warning and it is almost impossible to accurately predict the future. The UK has been in a long period where there has been no major threat to our security, freedom or prosperity. The potential for a major state threat or existential threat remains in what will always be a highly competitive and contested global environment. However, in this competitive environment, we must ensure that we are prepared to react to inevitable change. This is executed through diplomatic and economic activity, including membership of international organisations (for example, NATO, the EU, and the UN) and, if justified, our sovereign legal right to use force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within the international legal framework, Defence contributes significantly in supporting the government’s policy aim of influencing the behaviour of any group, nation or state that threatens the UK’s interests. Defence fulfils this through analysing the threat and then recommending the most appropriate response. This approach, known as full-spectrum targeting enables a graduated response (both physical
and psychological) to emerging threats and uses a range of Defence capabilities to achieve the desired effects.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence contributes to both deterrence and coercion strategies within an integrated approach. Therefore, the decision to deploy our Armed Forces is a continuation of the use of all of the instruments of national power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK’s International Defence Engagement Strategy (2013) aims to inform Defence engagement (out to a 20-year horizon) to achieve influence in a global context. Defence assets have greater utility beyond their threat or use of hard power. Defence engagement is the means by which the UK employs Defence assets and activities to achieve influence without the use or threat of force. However, although Defence engagement may reduce the chances of a conflict occurring, historical precedents illustrates that any kind of engagement, or public commitment, may draw the UK into conflicts it would otherwise not have been involved in.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are a number of policy goals for Defence engagement. The International Defence Engagement Strategy works towards policy end-states through four activities:
• security and non-combat operations;
• Defence diplomacy;
• Defence and security exports; and
• regional stability, conflict prevention, post-conflict reconstruction and stabilisation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence engagement activities are built upon developing and maintaining a network of contacts and relationships through all available channels and understanding the broader benefits of (at times) seemingly unrelated activity. This demands proactive investment. Commanders must champion those with the cultural capability, empathy, emotional intelligence and flair for engagement activity with the same vigour they champion their warfighters. International Defence engagement activity includes:
• treaties and alliances;
• senior-level visits;
• the Defence Attaché network;
• capacity building;
• civilian Defence advisers;
• loan-service personnel;
• overseas exchange and liaison officers;
• overseas training advisers;
• security sector reform;
• international Defence training;
• conventional deterrence and reassurance;
• overseas joint exercises;
• ship, unit and aircraft visits; and
• Defence sales and Defence industry cooperation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Nations cannot legally use force to proactively manage their international affairs. However, bounded by international law, nations can defend threats to their legitimate interests. Defence maintains the UK’s security by deterring and addressing threats to the UK’s national interests.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deterrence and coercion strategies aim to counter threats to the UK’s security by communicating to potential adversaries the consequences of their anticipated action or inaction. While the threat of a military response can influence our adversaries’ calculation of risk during confrontation, they must be convinced that the full potential costs (the military, economic and diplomatic reaction) of their actions will outweigh any possible benefits. Deterrence and coercion strategies differ:
• deterrence aims to dissuade a course of action; and
• coercion aims to encourage a course of action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In strategic terms, deterrence and coercion are ways by which the government might seek to secure policy ends. Deterrence is broader than the UK’s nuclear deterrent capability. The nuclear deterrent is only one of the ways the UK deters threats and aggression. Deterrence and coercion are also achieved through conventional means and a wider, more flexible range of postures and responses.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deterrence and coercion strategies will be contested and commanders must understand the weight of effort an opponent will apply to achieve their aims. Opponents will assess:
• how they value the interests of their state or group, compared to their opponents’ interests;
• their perception of the balance of power;
• the bargaining space and whether there are alternative acceptable outcomes available; and
• their expected gains and losses.
Therefore, fully understanding the context, including the cultural, institutional, ideological and motivational factors and the prevailing political, economic and strategic situation – as an opponent perceives it – is crucial.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
If we threaten to impose costs on an opponent to deter unwanted behaviour, we must also reassure them that if they comply then we will not impose those costs. Without this, there is little incentive for the opponent to comply. We can also incentivise opponents, either separately from, or in concert with, threats of force. Therefore, our deterrence and coercion strategies should employ all available national instruments (military, diplomatic and economic) in combination. Deterrence and coercion strategies are only viable if our threat of sanction is both credible and deliverable. Apparent weakness, or lack of resolve, is unlikely to deter threats.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deterrence and coercion activities aim to shape behaviour. However, behaviour can appear irrational for many reasons. This includes:
• ethnic interest groups pursuing their own, rather than national, interests;
• different priorities and beliefs;
• imperfect communication; and
• fatalistic attitude.
Behaviour that we perceive to be irrational may be wholly rational to others in pursuit of their interests. Due to a complex mixture of organisational, political and psychological factors, opponents often do not adhere to rational action as we might judge it. Nevertheless, while most states will not sacrifice their sovereignty or national survival, minimal pressure may be enough to convince an opponent to give up something less important.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deterrence and coercion strategies will only succeed if an opponent understands that the threats (or incentives) are credible. Effective deterrence and coercion strategies comprise four principles:
• credibility;
• communication;
• comprehension; and
• capability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A threat will only carry weight to the extent that an opponent believes there is sufficient will to carry it out. The threat of force is underpinned by battle- winning armed forces and we must retain the capability to use force when required. Credibility can be difficult to establish and maintain. While reputation, resolve and capability play a role, we do not own our credibility. Other participants judge our credibility and their beliefs are only partly affected by what we do. Recognising that we may only be able to make a limited impact on others' view of our credibility should influence our planning, and may save time and effort.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deterrence and coercion activity will only succeed if those we aim to influence understand the message conveyed. Communicating deterrence and coercion strategies is challenging. Mistakes can be made by incorrectly judging actions and words from one’s own perspective and assuming that what we mean to convey is understood. The clearest signals must be unambiguous, but are also the most expensive to make. There is a role for ambiguity, but this depends on our assessment of the target audience's appetite for risk.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Communication is further complicated by cultural and language barriers. Messages intended for one audience can be misunderstood by others. For example, messages to domestic audiences can have an unintended impact on the perceptions of a foreign audience. This can undermine a coherent messaging strategy and reduce the chances of deterrence or coercion succeeding. Also, in crisis and conflict, target audiences are often in stressful situations. Therefore, there may be significant limitations on their abilities – both technical and cognitive – to receive and process messages as we might hope or expect them to.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deterrence and coercion activities aim to prevent a crisis escalating. However, those same activities may have unintended effects, which could be more difficult to anticipate and control. Commanders must analyse, assess and understand likely outcomes and plan to counter these. We can improve our comprehension by:
• carefully framing our demands, including timelines;
• offering a choice of outcomes;
• remaining agile as a crisis unfolds;
• changing our posture; and
• using incentives and reassurance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deterrence will fail if an opponent believes that there is insufficient capability to deliver a threat, even if backed with strong political will. Our established martial tradition, proven operational experience and political resolve underpin capability. Deploying forces signals a very high level of political commitment: for conventional deterrence, the swiftness of deployment may be decisive. Demonstrating sufficient capability is key in all situations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Hard power uses military capability and economic strength (both sanctions and incentives) to influence the behaviour of states, groups or individuals, or to directly change the course of events. Those using hard power seek to coerce opponents to adopt a particular course of action, which they would not otherwise choose themselves. Military and economic capability are important sources of hard power – they also serve as deterrents.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
While hard power may offer a solution to one problem, it may undermine attempts to solve others. Therefore, while hard power may change behaviour, influence activities must consider the broader impact such action may have. Hard power must be viewed as a means to a political end-state and not an end in itself. Commanders must fully understand both the strategic aim and strategic narrative to ensure all action contributes to that end-state. Furthermore, historical precedent exists for hard power both generating and depleting soft power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Soft power may influence others to adopt a preferred course of action through cultural and ideological means or by encouraging emulation. The instruments of power, including Defence engagement activities, can make a significant contribution and can be used to support soft power being generated. Much of this process lies outside government control. Nevertheless, rather than relying solely on threatening or using military and economic strength, a state could attempt to achieve influence through communicating the attractiveness of its culture and ideology, or through proliferating its norms and values. Soft power is generally slower and more difficult to employ accurately. Therefore, applying soft power demands investing in time and very clear, consistent communication strategies. The ways in which soft power may be effective include:
• culture (when it is attractive to others);
• values (which are seen to be sincere in their application); and
• foreign policies (when they are seen as legitimate by others).
Any of which may be reinforced with financial and material incentives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
To use soft power effectively requires a developed understanding of the intended audience and their societal codes, beliefs and cultures. Although soft power may seem attractive, especially in terms of cost, hard power has a value, potency and immediacy of its own, especially in times of chronic instability or conflict.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK’s success in using soft power is derived from pursuing a long-term narrative which depicts the UK as a competent, robustly inclusive country, whose actions are defensibly legal. This builds trust and makes crisis response easier. Properly executed and coordinated Defence engagement can make a very cost- effective contribution to soft power strategies. Defence has many intangible resources including reputation, professionalism and integrity – and we should protect and maximise the value of these resources.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Hard power and soft power strategies are not bi-polar. Skilful diplomacy, across multiple government departments, will fuse both. This approach is commonly referred to as smart power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK’s response to global instability and conflict is to apply all of the instruments of national power to shape the global environment and tackle potential risks at source. This recognises the potential need for overseas military operations and that security is often a prerequisite for political and economic progress. Defence maintains the ability to respond to a full range of intervention scenarios to:
• prevent violent conflict;
• enable mediation;
• stabilise situations in, or emerging from, violent conflicts; and
• support recovery and reconstruction.
Annex 3A outlines when armed force may be used.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within an internationally-agreed legal framework, force may be used as part of a strategy to defend the UK’s legitimate interests. Force may be required to:
• counter an imminent threat;
• diminish our opponents capacity to act; and
• influence situations by degrading an opponent’s will and capability to act and ability to make timely and effective decisions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In applying force, threats may be countered by disrupting, defeating or destroying an opponent. In summary:
• disruption degrades specific parts of an opponent’s capability, both moral and physical, thereby limiting their freedom of action;
• defeat (a broader effect than simply disruption) diminishes an opponent’s will, cohesion and overall capacity to the extent that they are no longer able to maintain a tangible threat or prevent friendly forces from achieving their objectives; and
• destruction is the ultimate level of applied force, where it is considered necessary to eliminate a potential threat.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Effective military engagement depends on an accurate, detailed and informed understanding of the operational context. The operational context is defined by:
• physical factors;
• the relationships between internal and external actors; and 
• the prevailing cultural nuances and characteristics.
Conflict prevention
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Early Defence engagement can reduce the likelihood of prolonged instability and reduce military intervention. In addition, conflict prevention activities aim to reduce the possibility of escalation and promote sustainable post-conflict peace. This may reduce, or negate, the need for military intervention to deal with emerging crises, contribute to an understanding of emerging threats, or provide broader humanitarian assistance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The aim of military intervention is to contribute to peace enforcement or prevent a crisis from escalating and spreading. Focused intervention, using high- readiness forces, may neutralise an emerging threat by coercing actors to modify their behaviour. During peacekeeping operations, the situation may deteriorate unexpectedly demanding combat operations to separate or disarm belligerents. Intervention may involve other government departments, non-governmental organisations or other international organisations, whose capability to provide disaster relief may be hindered by insecurity and violence. Our capacity to operate effectively, underwritten by our combat power and readiness to act, can have a critical role in countering those seeking to promote instability.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There is unlikely to be complete consensus for an intervention, unless a state or nation’s very survival is threatened. Disaffected, displaced or disempowered elements can be expected to provide active opposition. This may include the use of armed force, intimidation and coercion by criminals, insurgents, opportunists and terrorists. In such situations, it may be necessary to maintain the security and confidence of the local population, concurrent with re-building, reforming or building the capacity of state institutions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Security and stabilisation activities involve regenerating and training an indigenous security forces capacity to both enable and sustain their recovery and own security. Commanders will operate within an integrated approach collaborating and cooperating with a broad range of stakeholders (potentially with competing perspectives). Other government departments and non-governmental organisations should take responsibility for many lines of operation, such as governance, reconstruction and development. However, experience and history demonstrate that this may not always be the case, especially when security cannot be guaranteed and resources, both human and materiel, are scarce. In such circumstances, commanders should be prepared, within their capabilities, training and authority, to deliver non- military lines of operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Combat may arise unexpectedly during peacekeeping or disaster relief operations, especially in volatile situations. Sporadic outbreaks of intense combat may also occur during otherwise prolonged periods of stable non-violent confrontation. Where force is applied in response to an unexpected deterioration in an otherwise secure environment, or to counter or contain sporadic violence, it is initially likely to be defensive in nature. Should those measures fail, offensive force may be applied to achieve specified objectives, including disrupting, defeating or destroying our opponents.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Combat may also reinforce an existing, but fragile, peace to stabilise a situation that risks escalating into major conflict, or establish security where it has broken down. Combat operations may be necessary to prevent instability from spreading to provide the security to enable other processes to resolve the more deep-seated causes of conflict. Defence’s role in these circumstances tends to be limited to creating and maintaining a stable environment in which underlying issues can be addressed by non-military means.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Major combat operations involve diplomatic, military and economic actions, unified by an overall strategy and, ultimately, the full resources of the state. Allied Joint Publication (AJP)-01, Allied Joint Doctrine provides the keystone doctrine for planning, executing and supporting Allied joint operations. Although AJP-01 is intended primarily for use by NATO forces, the doctrine is instructive to, and provides a useful framework for, operations conducted by a coalition of NATO partners, non- NATO nations and other organisations. JDP 01, UK Joint Operations Doctrine covers our national approach where it differs, or where we need more detail.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Major combat operations are characterised as a contest between the regular armed forces of states and/or action against large-scale irregular opponents. During major combat operations, the operational context is dominated by the need to maintain military freedom of action and to deny that freedom to an enemy. The size of the military footprint, the intensity and scale of the conflict, and the scope of the theatre of operations determine the extent to which civilian populations are exposed to the consequences of combat operations. Those planning major combat operations must consider and coordinate multinational support from allies, international opinion and the relative strength of the other instruments of national power in sustaining both fighting power and national resilience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Major combat operations demand significant financial and organisational commitment, with rehabilitation and recuperation implications that extend beyond the military and the immediate conflict. They are likely to be highly resource-intensive with often protracted and unrestrained violence. An asymmetric advantage in weight of effort or technological superiority can mitigate human and materiel losses. Although some routine and standing commitments will be maintained, such as protecting our overseas territories, fighting power should be concentrated on those aspects that contribute directly to the end-state.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
UK forces in combat are always subject to a distinctive legal framework, including international conventions and the Law of International Armed Conflict.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Protecting the UK includes having the capacity to deter and defeat military threats or incursions. Protection encompasses the integrity of the UK, its territorial waters and airspace, and provides support to other government departments (termed military aid to civil authorities in matters of security and law enforcement. Military aid to civil authorities may also involve limited manpower to assist local authorities during unforeseen contingencies or more significant resources to assist the civil power in countering, for example, terrorism. If a direct military threat to the UK mainland occurs, appropriate forces (either national or with allies and partners) would be provided to confront the specific threat and to deter further aggression. In most cases, it is anticipated that any substantial threat to the UK would involve using armed forces in a large-scale alliance or coalition operation. The UK also has recourse to strategic nuclear systems.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We also need to have the capability to protect any UK overseas territory or dependency facing a threat to its security. In some territories, local garrisons are maintained to deter aggression, enable overseas operations and support the civil authorities. In response to serious terrorist incidents, specialist forces may need to deploy. Circumstances may need us to use armed force to mount a large-scale national operation, employing the full range of conventional military capabilities, to fight a limited, but intense, conflict at a considerable distance from the UK.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Under Chapter VII, Articles 43 and 45 of the UN Charter, all members are to make available armed forces to contribute to maintaining international peace and security. As a permanent member of the UN Security Council responsible for making the decision to use armed force in response to threats to the peace, breaches of the peace and acts of aggression, the UK has a particular responsibility to act.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Membership of NATO involves political obligations (under the terms of the Washington Treaty) which may include assisting an ally, even if the UK’s security is not directly threatened. Also (or alternatively) the EU may request member states to take action (under the modified Brussels Treaty) in certain circumstances. Armed forces may also be deployed as part of a multinational force in a wide variety of operations as a result of decisions taken, and direction, given by the North Atlantic Council or the EU Council of Ministers.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We may also be used to promote national interests across the entire spectrum of military activities, including support to diplomacy, military assistance, humanitarian intervention and peacekeeping operations, through to major warfighting. Such engagement is based on assessing the balance of risk and advantages in committing military forces. In view of the UK’s widespread interests and investments, as well as its critical dependence on a stable, secure international environment for trade, it is likely that threats to international security would also represent a threat to our national interests. In these circumstances, Defence may contribute to operations as part of an alliance or coalition, but may have to act alone to protect or promote national interests. In certain situations, the interests at stake may be only indirectly pertinent to the national interest, in a narrow sense, but it may be judged expedient to intervene on humanitarian, compassionate or moral grounds.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We live in an inherently multipolar world, marked by a strategic context that is complex, dynamic and unstable. The UK and our allies face a diverse range of threats. Land power is an indispensable component of military and national power, offering policy makers scalable and responsive options to protect the UK, fight our enemies, prevent conflict and deal with disaster. Since it is on the land that people live and where decisions are made, land power is unique in providing the ability to exert decisive control and influence on actors and the course of events. Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 0-20, UK Land Power, for the first time in joint doctrine, describes the context, utility and application of land power in the context of joint and multinational operations. It recognises that the nature of war remains constant: it is visceral, violent, characterised by friction that makes the simplest things difficult, and its outcomes are more often determined by the effects on people’s minds than by physical effects, and it is always about politics. But we now live in an age where information is pervasive and driving a rapidly evolving character of conflict, opening new ways for state and non-state adversaries to exploit ambiguity, blurring the boundaries of peace and war. This makes for an era of constant competition. The battlefield is increasingly decentralised with a premium placed on the talent of junior leaders within land forces, and their ability to understand the strategic context. There are also no boundaries between what happens abroad and what happens at home. And expectations of military restraint, as well as the complexity of the legal framework, constrain commanders as never before. In this context, strategic success is more likely to be achieved through non-military or non-lethal means, and invariably it is the triumph of the narrative that is decisive and not necessarily the facts on the ground. The two central ideas in UK land doctrine endure. Mission command, based on mutual trust between leaders and those whom they lead, empowers commanders at all levels, generating agility and tempo, and enabling us to overcome enemies in the most chaotic and demanding circumstances. The manoeuvrist approach is our fighting doctrine, focused on the enemy – but the pervasiveness of information demands that manoeuvre has to take account of a broader audience than simply the ‘enemy’. This requires a new idea – called integrated action. This is a unifying doctrine that requires commanders first to identify the desired outcome, to consider all the audiences relevant to attaining the outcome, to analyse the effects required on the relevant audience and then to determine the best mix of capabilities, from soft through to hard power, to achieve the outcome. As doctrine, UK Land Power captures a set of beliefs that underpin how land forces practice their profession. It has been written primarily for joint staffs, officials, allies and partners in industry. I encourage you to read it as a framework for understanding how land forces perform their vital role in protecting our nation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land power is defined as: the ability of land forces to exert decisive control and influence on actors and the course of events. At the heart of UK land power is the capacity of UK land forces to fight and succeed in combat against our adversaries. Our land forces can take physical possession of terrain, or physically defend and secure it, delivering the enduring physical presence necessary to influence political decisions. The forward presence of land forces can also deter aggression by altering an adversary’s cost-benefit analysis of aggressive action, and can bolster an ally’s will and capability to resist coercion.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK’s national strategy coordinates the instruments of national power. UK land power, along with maritime, air and space power, form the interdependent levers of the military instrument of national power. The absence of any one of these levers creates potential vulnerabilities that our enemies may exploit. The military instrument’s unique contribution is to threaten, or apply, legitimate force in pursuit of national policy objectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land power is generated and applied by our land forces. UK land forces protect the UK, fight our enemies, prevent future conflict and deal with disaster, both at home and overseas. Driven by the proliferation and speed of information flows, the strategic context within which our land forces operate is increasingly unstable and complex. It is characterised by a state of constant competition that blurs traditional distinctions between war and peace. We increasingly use and contest the virtual domain through digital media and cyber. Foreign and homeland threats have also merged. Future conflict will likely mean attacks on UK sovereign territory, including sabotage, terrorism and civil disturbances. War, therefore, no longer remains confined to fixed battlefields.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within this context, land power continues to offer scalable and responsive options to our Government in shaping the international security environment. Our land forces undertake a wide variety of tasks, ranging from war fighting through to delivering security, peace support and Defence engagement. Within these tasks sit a broad range of activities, including combat and stability operations (such as counter-irregular activity such as counter-insurgency, counterterrorism and counter-criminality), as well as humanitarian assistance and disaster relief and the provision of military aid to the civil authorities. To fulfil these tasks, our land forces are held at the appropriate readiness so that they can be properly prepared and applied at the right time and place, overseas and at home. The functions of UK land power underpin its broad utility in support of national strategy, and are described in Figure 1.
<|endoftext|>
 

<|startoftext|>
Land power, however, is not employed in isolation. Instead, a joint approach to applying military power (whereby a combination of scalable maritime, land, air, space, cyber or special forces operate together within a single military force) can integrate capabilities and provide powerful synergies. The land, maritime, air and space environments, as well as cyberspace, are clearly connected to one another, and the force elements associated with each can, and do, routinely create effects in other environments. The wealth of information in the virtual domain must also be exploited; generating understanding depends heavily upon our ability to access and make sense of the rapidly increasing volumes and variety of data available. Cyberspace therefore presents significant opportunities and threats as information technologies continue to transform how land forces operate with, among and against other actors. Strong alliances and partnerships worldwide are also more important than ever because the complex nature of the threats we face increasingly require a multi-faceted response. Furthermore, effective crisis management requires active cross-government and multi-agency cooperation to develop and sustain a comprehensive and successful response.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within a dynamic strategic context, the distinguishing characteristic of the land environment is the presence of humans in large numbers. Land forces are able to engage directly with friendly, neutral and adversary actors, potentially seizing and holding terrain for extended periods to create the conditions in which a favourable political outcome can be reached.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Taken together, our soldiers, presence, persistence and versatility form the attributes of land forces. These attributes are explored in further detail in Chapter 3. In an operating environment shaped by human dynamics, our soldiers remain at the heart of land forces. Land forces depend on the abilities of professional, innovative, adaptable individuals, moulded by training, education and discipline into cohesive teams, who can react quickly to changing conditions. They accomplish missions face to face, providing essential human interaction in the midst of societal, environmental, religious and political upheaval. It is their presence amongst local populations that enables this success. Land forces not only seize, occupy and defend areas of land, they also have the persistence and durability to remain in a region until long-term strategic objectives have been achieved. Land forces are a highly versatile element of the joint force, fulfilling multiple functions across the breadth of strategic requirements. Even when optimised for war fighting, land forces can conduct a wide range of engagement, security and support tasks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces are uniquely postured to influence human activity. Across the broad range of activities they undertake, our land forces can carry a message of reassurance, deterrence or potentially coercion, depending on the mission context. Adaptable land forces can transition rapidly between tasks, offering a nuanced, tailored response to evolving circumstances.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Credible and capable land forces, as part of a cross-government approach (usually framed within a wider multinational and multi-agency response), can deter potential adversaries from aggression. Persistent engagement overseas also:
• demonstrates a tangible level of political commitment;
• contributes further to conflict prevention by fostering mutual understanding through military-to-military contacts; and
• helps partners to build the capacity to operate more effectively.
Such activities strengthen alliances and partnerships and provide the security and stability that benefits UK prosperity. Persistent engagement overseas also provides our land forces with the insight and understanding that enable them to operate with agility and precision in a context of uncertainty. It also facilitates regional access and enables the contextual understanding necessary for the success of potential subsequent operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Our land forces also support and assist both domestic and international communities as they recover from natural and humanitarian disasters. This usually occurs as part of a wider military response that provides the speed, personnel, equipment and experience required to respond effectively to a given crisis.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Certain situations, including threats to our national security may require a response that calls for the physical control of territory. The unique ability of land forces to seize and hold ground affords the potential to fulfil this requirement, and signifies the highest levels of political commitment. Control brings responsibility that must be planned for at all levels. The manner in which control is asserted, through image, word and deed, and by addressing a broad range of audiences, ensures control constitutes a positive element of strategy. The exercise of control can:
• remove or weaken an enemy’s power base;
• directly impose our will upon our adversaries;
• provide a secure environment in which wider objectives can be achieved;
• send a deterrent message to our adversaries; and
• reassure our allies.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Because of its significance, the physical capture and control of territory, or the credible threat to do so, has often been regarded as decisive. But, the ultimate decision is political; people have to decide whether or not to accept the facts on the ground. Land forces, through their presence among, and proximity to, the people, provide an important contribution to achieving these political outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Underpinning all that our land forces do is the ability to fight, and to succeed in combat against our adversaries. Since the nature of land operations most closely aligns with the human dynamic that lies at the heart of all war, the ability to prevail in ground combat can be decisive in breaking the enemy’s will. Thinking, adaptive enemies cannot be defeated at range. Soldiers possessing the unique capability to find, fix, close with and defeat our enemies are therefore required to achieve sustainable strategic outcomes. Perceptions of our combat capabilities also reinforce our capacity to influence other actors, including the credibility of efforts to deter adversaries, as well as the ability to reassure allies and partners.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At all levels of war (tactical, operational and strategic), the successful employment of land power requires force elements that are able to adapt to meet the requirements of a specific context. That context has changed significantly over the past three decades, and continues to do so. In an interconnected world, success is contingent on achieving favourable consensus among multiple local, regional and global audiences. Tactical military success can only be translated into desirable political outcomes as part of an effective political strategy that draws on the full spectrum of levers available to achieve objectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The successful employment of UK land power must therefore be predicated upon sound strategic thinking. Within this complex operating environment, a flexible and agile approach to strategy and warfare allows the development of a campaign based on achievable objectives, but which can respond to unexpected events and crises. Such an approach, which focuses on closing out our opponent’s courses of action, whilst preserving and creating our own options, will be more flexible and ultimately underpins the effective employment of land power. Directed at affecting and influencing the perceptions of a wide range of audiences, this approach must also be based on intimate knowledge and understanding of the tasks at hand, including:
• what is required to attain those tasks;
• any impediments and obstacles;
• the alternatives;
• the resources required; and
• the consequences of various courses of action.
Within a cross-government information strategy, a common strategic narrative must also underpin the employment of UK land power, outlining why the UK is engaged and its objectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated action is the unifying doctrine which guides how our land forces orchestrate and execute operations in an interconnected world, where the range of threats we face is diverse. It recognises that success in the contemporary operating environment requires more than physical and cognitive effect on the enemy – it also requires the concurrent (and deliberate) ability to influence much wider audiences, including local political actors, the local population, indigenous partners, as well as broader allies. It is outcome-focused and requires sophisticated understanding and the integration of all capabilities available. These themes are explored further in Chapter 4.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The effectiveness of land power varies according to how well we tailor its employment to a particular context. The land environment itself, with all its enduring challenges and opportunities, as well as the unchanging political, adversarial and human nature of war, must be understood. But the character of every conflict also varies – political objectives differ between conflicts, the capacity and capabilities of adversaries relative to our own will never be the same and the audiences we seek to influence through our actions will change. Land power must be adapted to successfully meet the requirements of every context, balancing a readiness for those elements that remain constant, with an ability to react rapidly to changing circumstances. An effective political strategy must underpin this approach, founded upon an adaptable land force able to integrate the full range of lethal and non-lethal 
The land environment
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The land environment is inherently complex, and is shaped primarily by human, information and physical aspects. Unlike the air or maritime environments, it is distinguished by the fact that it is where people predominantly live. It is in the land environment that the roots of conflict are usually found, since conflict on land involves those things that people tend to value most: their lives, values, property and resources.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land has immense practical and symbolic significance for human beings. Within the land environment, people inhabit towns, cities and villages, whilst even apparently unpopulated space often contains resources that support humans in some way. Control over land is consequently of fundamental political, cultural and psychological importance, and has often been regarded as decisive in conflict. Control of territory alone, however, is rarely sufficient – our actions must be supported by a broad range of audiences if they are to contribute to the successful achievement of desired outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
People exist in linguistic, cultural, social and political groups with specific identities, usually associated with particular territories. Individually or collectively they form the audiences whose perception and interpretation of events, and subsequent behaviour and decisions, determine how conflict is conducted and resolved. These audiences may include those deployed, as well as broader international audiences, including those in the conflict region. They may be hostile, friendly or neutral to the actions of land forces, although the boundaries between these groups are not fixed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The land environment is shaped by the way that these populations interact; it is the exchange of information between individuals, tribes, ethnic and interest groups, and countries that lie at the heart of human dynamics. This communication can be verbal, written or visual and it can be conducted directly between people or through radio, television or online. Human interaction is expanding and accelerating as information flows in the virtual domain increase, linking individuals, groups and societies globally, unconfined by traditional state boundaries. The proximity of land forces to local populations allows them to distinguish between different people and groups, adjusting their interaction accordingly. Land forces therefore require a unique set of ‘people skills’, including empathy, emotional intelligence, an understanding of culture and history, and an ability to communicate in the local language.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
It is through this exchange of information that individuals come to understand their environment, to articulate purposes and to frame processes of conflict and cooperation. As a means of influence, land forces must therefore understand what information is relevant, to whom, how it is received, and how it might influence people’s decision-making and behaviours. We must also understand how land forces and other actors compete for influence by using information, in both the physical and virtual domains.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The land environment is varied and complex. It includes open grassland, cultivated land, forests, mountains, deserts, jungles, rivers, swamps, urban and littoral areas. Each creates constraints and freedoms, placing different demands on the people and equipment that operate within them. Terrain can block or enable communication, provide cover from detection or attack, and obstruct or enable movement. Variations in elevation and vegetation limit visibility and the effects of weapons, whilst movement on land is impeded and channelled by obstacles that land forces must overcome. Climate accentuates the demands of terrain, and may affect visibility, movement and communication. Extremes of heat and cold can create hostile physical and psychological conditions for land forces. Night operations can provide cover and the element of surprise, but challenge the ability to retain effective command and control. Changes in climate can bring danger and threaten our very survival, but also potentially bring opportunities that sustain life and provide protection.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The land itself can be altered by human activity. Obstacles can be cleared and roads built to enable access. Ground can be fortified or provided with physical defences, whilst certain types of pollution can amplify survival challenges. Globally, the phenomenon of urbanisation has created physically, culturally and institutionally complex cities that are challenging for military forces operating in them, not least due to the force ratios traditionally required for success in urban operations on this scale. Where cities are located on the littoral – a complex operating environment in its own right – these complexities are amplified and even more dynamic. Land forces have to be highly adaptable and resilient to operate successfully in these different conditions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces must maximise the opportunities and advantages presented by the human, information and physical aspects of the land environment and eliminate, reduce or mitigate the challenges that they pose. Understanding this context at all levels, whether strategic, operational or tactical, and adapting the use of land forces accordingly, therefore underpins the successful employment of land power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The nature of war does not change. Armed conflict remains an inherently chaotic, visceral and violent contest, whose underlying nature is human, adversarial and political.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The character of conflict, however, shaped by the age in which it is fought, continues to evolve. Human developments (such as technology, laws, social attitudes, philosophy, religion and international relationships) will all change the way that conflicts are prosecuted. The character of contemporary conflict is shaped by an increasingly uncertain and complex operating environment. In a strategic context characterised by constant confrontation, traditional interpretations of peace and war can be increasingly difficult to distinguish.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The distinctions that we can make between the nature of war and the character of conflict inform our approach to force development and design, doctrine, education and training. Deductions regarding the nature of war inform enduring principles and ideas, whilst deductions related to the character of conflict allow us to prepare appropriately for the more detailed requirements of contemporary operations. It is essential to draw on both in the right balance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
War has certain intrinsic attributes that transcend individual clashes and disputes. The nature of war will continue to be influenced by, and representative of, the entire spectrum of human behaviour, emotion and capability. Human emotions such as fear and anger can shape why we fight and what we fight for. Combat against an armed adversary is an intense, lethal human activity. War is marked by violence, danger, stress, fear, exhaustion, isolation and privation that can adversely affect the will of all those involved. The battlefield often teems with non-combatants and is crowded with infrastructure. No matter how great the quantity of information available, a ‘fog of war’ caused by limitations in our ability to understand the dynamics of a situation will lead to uncertainty and chaos.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Human attributes also determine how we fight. Our physiology, challenged by the arduous nature of the land environment, defines what we can do physically. Land forces must be able to endure in the most hostile conditions, requiring high levels of resilience in individuals, as well as command and support structures and equipment. Human cognitive limitations also mean that our decisions and behaviour are often matters of perception – it is therefore particularly important for land forces to understand how to influence and assess human behaviour, and how the audience is likely to perceive our actions. Our soldiers respond to effective leadership. Amongst other qualities, commanders must be flexible, decisive, resilient in the face of adversity, judicious and able to inspire others.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
For land forces operating in a context of friction, uncertainty and chaos, a decentralised command system is necessary, empowering subordinate commanders and promoting initiative, freedom and speed of action. For UK land forces this is incorporated into the command philosophy of mission command. It empowers leaders down to the lowest level, enabling subordinate commanders to rapidly identify and exploit opportunities to achieve their commander’s intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
War remains adversarial. It is a reciprocal contest of wills against opponents that think, react and adapt. As the contemporary strategist Colin Gray notes, the adversarial nature of war means ‘that every cunning plan has to succeed against, not blind nature, but rather an adversary with whom you conduct a permanent tactical, operational, strategic, and political-moral dialogue.’ UK land forces embrace a fighting doctrine known as the manoeuvrist approach. It is an indirect approach which advocates the application of strength against enemy vulnerabilities. It blends lethal and non-lethal actions to achieve objectives which shape the enemy’s understanding, undermine their will and break their cohesion.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The ends towards which all conflict is fought are dictated by policy. War is therefore a means to an end, not an end in itself. These ends may be clearly defined or they may be ambiguous, and their legitimacy and utility may be challenged within our democratic society. But the fact remains that, as Clausewitz notes, war ‘is controlled by a political objective’, and this objective ‘will set its course, prescribe the scale of means and effort which is required, and makes its influence felt throughout down to the smallest operational detail.’ Political contexts tend to alter over time: events may create new realities; new domestic political dynamics can emerge; and balances of power can change. In consequence, the purpose of a conflict; its value; the costs and benefits; and the military and political constraints and imperatives, may all change in quite fundamental ways as a conflict develops. These changes necessarily shape the manner in which operations must be conducted by land forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Unlike the nature of war, the character of conflict is subject to change. Whilst predicting the precise character of future conflict is impossible, the character of a particular conflict will be shaped by factors such as its geography, participants and the type of tactics and technology that adversaries employ.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The pervasive nature of information has changed the character of contemporary conflict. The increased availability and flow of information enables messages and ideas to be rapidly communicated across physical boundaries. In this interconnected operating environment, military activity is often immediately visible to local, regional and global audiences. The local and regional audience includes enemies, adversaries and a range of actors, from allies and partners to the local population. The global audience is unbounded, blurring previous operational and non-operational distinctions; even relatively minor armed conflicts have potentially global consequences. Each of these groups interprets our activity through their own lens, and each is influenced by others. Critically, it is the perceptions of these audiences that determine the success of military action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Comparatively open access to the virtual domain allows our adversaries to:
• communicate ideas;
• develop and exploit recruitment opportunities;
• influence audiences;
• mobilise resources; and
• identify targets.
Many actors are adept at presenting military activity to the audience, magnifying, mitigating or altering it to influence observers’ understanding of what actually happened. Information and propaganda campaigns using ‘facts’ – even if they are wrong or invented – to appeal to emotions more than logic, are hard to rebut. Indeed, now more than ever, no conflict has a purely military solution. Instead, a compelling strategic narrative, reinforced at operational and tactical levels, and with enduring coherence between actions and words, has the potential to be decisive in developing favourable consensus.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The increased visibility of our actions, and the manner in which we conduct operations, has led to greater political, public and international scrutiny and accountability. Recent operational experience has demonstrated that this dynamic can potentially lead to policy constraints on the use of force, over and above the requirements of domestic law, the Law of Armed Conflict and general international law. This, in turn, creates potential advantages, or perceptions of advantage, for our adversaries who may not choose to be bound in the same way.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Potential adversaries, both state and non-state, are increasingly demonstrating the will and capability to undermine Western operational capability, resolve and legitimacy by blending conventional and unconventional forms of conflict, using both attributable and non-attributable methods. Our opponents’ methods, which can be applied in ways that remain below well-established military response thresholds, include posturing, provocation and persuasion in the physical and virtual domains, subversion, economic and cyber warfare, with or without employing conventional military forces. This ‘hybrid’ threat to the international rules-based order can blur our interpretation of the thresholds between peace and armed conflict.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Battlefields are no longer fixed. Threats that manifest overseas are also often blurred with those at home as our adversaries seek to exploit our vulnerabilities. High impact terrorist attacks are designed to seize the initiative and shape the political agenda, whilst both state and non-state adversaries seek to influence the perceptions of our domestic population. We can no longer expect most potential adversaries to mass for major engagements, rather, they will disperse to mitigate the West’s advantages in air power and long-range stand-off fires. This complexity places even greater requirements on leadership at junior levels by demanding that they operate with autonomy and lead dispersed, agile units that can rapidly concentrate.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The proliferation of commercially available technology also increases the potential capability and effectiveness of our adversaries, both state and non-state. Secure communications, cyber capabilities and surveillance systems, including unmanned air systems, are affordable and can be easily acquired or improvised. Chemical weapons have been used, whilst biological, nuclear and radiological weapons remain a threat. In particular, cyber and electromagnetic activities present significant opportunities and threats. From the use of digital communication systems through to global positioning systems (GPS) and weapon guidance systems, cyberspace and the electromagnetic environment routinely provide the medium through which operations are planned by land forces, and make an increasingly important contribution to their execution. Hostile actors constantly probe our systems to seek vulnerabilities, intelligence and advantage, and yet these actions are often difficult to attribute to any state or group, creating unique challenges when formulating an appropriate response.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The outcomes of a cyber attack may be physical, but the majority are created through the virtual and cognitive domains. Effects may be unpredictable, and will vary depending upon the attacker’s intent and nature of the payload. Land forces must therefore protect against cyber attacks, while remaining capable of planning and executing operations with reduced or denied access to cyberspace and the electromagnetic environment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Every land force has inherent attributes which underpin their relative strengths and limitations. As discussed in Chapter 1, the four attributes of land forces are: soldiers, presence, persistence and versatility. Building on these attributes, a land force also needs to demonstrate certain qualities if it is to be able to exercise land power effectively, in particular the quality of adaptability. The overall operational effectiveness of a force is captured by the concept of fighting power. Fighting power consists of three components: the conceptual, the moral and the physical.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The enduring attributes of land forces are shaped by the distinct characteristics of the land environment, as well as the enduring nature of war. These attributes create advantages and opportunities which enable the broad utility of land power, although the employment of land forces must also acknowledge the potential challenges they may generate.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The primary attribute of any land force is its soldiers. Land conflict is a fundamentally human activity and, as such, it cannot be reduced to scientific templates and principles, but rather it relies on human initiative, enterprise and intelligence. Land forces are therefore complex organisations, requiring moral and structural cohesion. This complexity can make land forces difficult to direct, so decentralised command systems tend to work best. Drills and standardised practices can also help achieve common understanding and unity of effort. In a land force the fighting soldier will always be the fundamental constituent of capability, be it moving among, interacting with and reassuring a population under stress, or applying extreme physical violence. Our leaders and soldiers are moulded by training, education and discipline into cohesive teams with high morale and the will to win. A reliance on its people, however, also means that the effectiveness of a land force is dependent upon its ability to recruit and effectively train the necessary number of personnel.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
UK land forces also embrace the Whole Force approach advocated across Defence, which ensures unity of effort across outputs delivered by the right mix of capable and motivated people – regular and reserve Service personnel, MOD civil servants, contractors and other civilians. This means that the land force will consist of a diverse range of people, all of whom must integrate to deliver required outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces’ presence on the ground means that they operate in close proximity to people and terrain. First hand interaction with diverse people, places and cultures, as well as exposure to developing problems and threats, provides land forces with the potential to develop a detailed understanding of the human, information and physical aspects of the environment. They can get close enough to distinguish between different people and groups and communicate directly with them, adjusting their approach accordingly.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces present a particular kind of threat to adversaries, whilst their presence also has the unique capacity to reassure neutral and friendly individuals and groups. Land forces can manoeuvre over ground, or via air or water, to take physical possession of terrain, or they can physically defend or secure it. The forward presence of credible and capable land forces also forms an important aspect of our ability to both deter adversary aggression, and to reassure our allies and partners. In addition, it may be necessary for an intervening force to stand between two or more hostile forces to stabilise the situation before peace can become a possibility. The presence of land forces can therefore be decisive.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The attribute of persistence – the capacity of land forces to extend their presence and endure in an area for long periods of time – gives land forces the potential to broaden and deepen their understanding of the local context. The sustained presence of land forces before, during and after a conflict also allows them to engage with, influence and assist local populations and civil authorities, varying their actions according to the situation to make permanent the otherwise temporary gains achieved through combat. Together, the presence and persistence of land forces may be necessary to achieve and sustain a political outcome. Furthermore, persistent overseas engagement by land forces not only builds up vital multinational partnerships, but also ensures access to regional bases should land forces have to deploy to a particular region. Forces deployed for extended periods also require sustainment and protection commensurate with the threats and distance from the home base.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Versatility underpins the ability of a land force to perform many functions; it lies at the heart of land power’s broad strategic utility. Land forces have inherent versatility because they consist largely of organised groups with the ability to conduct a wide range of military and non-military tasks. So, even when optimised for war fighting, land forces retain broad utility. Land forces can perform a wide range of engagement, security and support tasks. Such versatility requires balanced capabilities, organised appropriately for specific tasks. Physical (our equipment) and structural (the way we are organised) versatility is enhanced by cognitive versatility (the ability of our people, backed by effective education, training, common doctrine and mutual understanding, to switch effectively between tasks). However, no land force is infinitely versatile. Factors such as the size of a land force and its objectives, equipment, structure and training will place practical limits on its ability to meet particular contingencies.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although all land forces display the four attributes to a greater or lesser extent, it does not follow that they will succeed on operations. As a relative concept, land power must be adjusted appropriately to the context in which it is employed if it is to achieve desired outcomes. The adaptability of our land forces is the pre-eminent quality which ensures that land power remains relevant in new and changing situations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although land forces are inherently versatile, they require adaptability to deal with new and changing situations, embracing the need to learn quickly and to change plans accordingly. The character of future conflict cannot be predicted accurately, so land forces must prepare for the most complex and demanding operations but also maintain the agility to adapt rapidly to specific operational requirements. Adaptable land forces are able to recognise and understand new challenges, experiment with solutions and implement effective responses at a higher tempo than the enemy. This allows them to seize and maintain the initiative and exploit opportunities. Our land forces’ command philosophy, mission command, embraces decentralised execution, providing the freedom of action to adapt to circumstances within the commander’s intent. Adaptability is further enabled by a number of factors, including education, creativity and common doctrine.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fighting power is a concept that describes the operational effectiveness of armed forces, or any element of them. Fighting power recognises the fact that forces do not simply consist of such tangibles as people and equipment, they also have intangible conceptual and moral properties that can play a decisive role in shaping their effective employment. The drive to achieve the right balance of fighting power guides force development and preparation, with each component adjusted as necessary to meet the needs of a specific context. Fighting power is therefore intrinsically linked to the required quality of adaptability. It consists of three components.
a. The conceptual component. The conceptual component of fighting power rests on the development and application of doctrine, a set of fundamental principles by which land forces guide their actions in support of objectives. Agile, not dogmatic, doctrine takes past experience and extracts guidance for dealing with future challenges, providing a foundation from which initiative can be applied with confidence. An understanding of relevant doctrine, as well as the dynamics of any given situation, provides the context, insight and foresight required for effective decision-making. The flexibility to adapt to deal with complex, dynamic challenges is another essential element of the conceptual component. Realistic and demanding training to develop core skills, along with organisational and technological flexibility, based on doctrine and supported by effective lessons processes, underpin the ability to adapt successfully.
b. The moral component. The moral component concerns the human aspect of fighting power. It supplies and sustains our land forces’ will to fight. It has three mutually dependent elements.
• High morale enables the land force to fight and overcome the privations of conflict. Moral cohesion contributes to this success, providing a sense of shared identity and purpose that binds individuals into teams, and teams into effective fighting forces. Moral cohesion is sustained by shared values and standards which guide the actions of every soldier.
• Land forces rely on the strength of their leaders at all levels to establish and sustain motivation, morale, moral cohesion and trust. Their vision, intellect, communication and unceasing motivation pave the path through chaos and confusion.
• To be effective, a force’s actions must reflect a sound and appropriate ethical, moral and legal foundation. These actions are guided by their obligations as soldiers and an ethical foundation shared with that of UK society. The Values and Standards of the British Army are the practical code that fulfils this foundation. The values of courage, discipline, respect for others, integrity, loyalty and selfless commitment together guide our actions. They demand that the actions of our land forces are lawful, appropriate and totally professional.
c. The physical component. The physical component of fighting power provides the means to fight. Our ability to attract, recruit and retain the right people, with the right skills, in the right quantity and at the right time is critical to its fighting power. Manpower and equipment are converted into ready, deployable and resilient forces by education and training. Training must be realistic, providing the forcing function for wider innovation and adaptation, as well as creating the conditions in which our Army’s fighting spirit can be developed. Training must therefore become ‘surrogate warfare’ – it needs to replicate the challenge of combat so that it inculcates the confidence and tactical innovation necessary to prevail in war. Sustainability is also essential; even if the force is fully manned and has all the necessary equipment, if it cannot be sustained, it cannot be employed as intended. The physical component is also reliant on wider resources; manning, equipping, training and sustaining armed forces costs money. The physical component of land forces can be broken down into units and formations, or by the function that they fulfil. These constituent parts are detailed at Annex 3A.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fighting power can only be applied if it is held at the appropriate readiness, can be deployed in time, and then recovered for the next operation. Readiness applies to all components of fighting power. The deployment and recovery of land forces also requires organic and non-organic, including joint, enablers. For example, the joint force may enable the deployment of a land force to a point of disembarkation from which it may need to project itself overland for long distances. Fighting power also varies depending on the level of interoperability which the force can achieve with other military formations and with other actors. These factors must be accounted for when considering the employment of land forces in a wider context based on their readiness state and overall military utility in a given situation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces are generally structured hierarchically into formations, units and sub-units and categorised by function and type. They are organised on operations by combining arms to form a cohesive and versatile whole.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Table 3A.1 shows the typical hierarchy that flows down from corps, division, brigade, unit and sub-unit. Formations and units are designed to be modular and scalable, so that elements can be easily added or taken away, and they can be expanded or contracted.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces are categorised functionally as combat, combat support or combat service support force elements (see table 3A.2). In addition, the UK also has specialist forces trained for: capacity building tasks; air and amphibious manoeuvre; force protection tasks; and intelligence and reconnaissance tasks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Complementary to functional categorisation, land forces are also distinguished by their force type, commonly described in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as heavy, medium or light depending on the vehicles and equipment they use. These force types are brought together (task organised) for specific roles or tasks – with force design having to make trade-offs between protection, firepower, operational and tactical mobility, and logistic demand.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The combination of capabilities provided by different force elements and types, when they have sufficiently high levels of interoperability, produces extremely powerful combined arms forces. A battle group is a combined arms force commanded by a combat unit headquarters made up of a combination of sub-units drawn from across the functional areas. A task force refers to a combined arms force created for a specific purpose. It is based on the headquarters of any type of force, at unit and formation level, and is not limited to a combat arm.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Task organisation is the process by which combined arms forces are formed. Task organisation during operations increases flexibility. Task organisation may take place at any level within UK land forces and can, with some limitations, occur within a multinational context. It is enabled by clearly defined command relationships between formations, units and sub-units.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land power encompasses the employment of UK land forces – in conjunction with joint, multi-agency, multinational and private sector partners – to achieve a broad range of political objectives. In an operating environment defined by complexity and uncertainty, our land forces are capable of exerting land power for strategic effect across a range of tasks, whether deterring adversaries, defeating our enemies, building partnerships or improving stability. This broad utility is encapsulated by the four functions of UK land power – fight, engage, secure and support. But, they are underpinned by the manner in which our land forces orchestrate and execute operations. At the heart of this is integrated action – our ability to intelligently harness lethal and non-lethal capabilities to achieve desired outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The functions of UK land power cohere with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) operations themes of war fighting, security, peace support and peacetime military engagement. The effective exercise of each function is enabled by joint, cross-government, multi-agency and multinational partners. Conversely, each of the functions of UK land power frequently create the conditions for our partners to engage, allowing them to operate where they would otherwise be unable.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Each function can be exercised independently, but most operations are likely to involve some combination of the four functions, either sequentially or in parallel. For example, while one element of the force is fighting our enemies, others may be engaged in humanitarian relief or capacity building. This versatility is an inherent requirement for success in complex land operations, usually conducted in the midst of non-combatants. Figure 4.1 illustrates the functions of UK land power.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although land power’s contribution to deterrence and coercion is significant, it is not considered as an individual function. Instead, deterrence and coercion, underpinned by credible and capable land forces, run as a thread throughout each function. Forward deployed, actively engaged land forces have proven essential to conflict prevention by reassuring our allies and deterring our adversaries. This includes all training activity conducted by UK land forces. Training not only underpins fighting power, but can also reassure allies and simultaneously communicate our determination and credibility to potential adversaries. Fight
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The core capability of land forces is the ability to fight and succeed in combat against our adversaries. Whilst the frequency and scale of combat may vary, the ability to fight effectively remains essential. The ability to prevail in ground combat can be a decisive factor in breaking the enemy’s will; our soldiers possess the unique capability to find, fix, close with, and defeat adversaries. This requires the skilled use of combined arms and the ability to fight using all available combat power in complementary ways. The ability to fight underpins all functions of land power and is essential for intervention and territorial defence, as well as our ability to deter adversaries.
Engage
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Early and persistent engagement overseas by our land forces develops regional insight and understanding, and helps to shape international security. Such engagement not only improves the capacity of host nations to handle their own internal security challenges and establishes enduring relationships with regional military and political leaders, but also represents a commitment that demonstrates the UK’s resolve. Soldiers are particularly important in this effort, since all nations have land security elements, even if they lack credible air and naval forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Overseas engagement by our land forces takes several forms. Capacity building is aimed at reinforcing local stability, developing good governance and enhancing partner nation resilience. Security cooperation deals, including the maintenance of close bilateral relationships with specified partner nations, help to foster exchanges and grow capabilities. Finally, improved compatibility in capabilities and procedures enables the UK to work alongside allies and partners. All of these activities provide our land forces with the insight and understanding which enable them to operate with agility and precision in a context of uncertainty. In turn, this facilitates regional access, leaving us better prepared in the event of a need to intervene.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Engagement is most effective when initiated in peacetime, since it may help to avert instability and prevent conflict, although it will continue if necessary through conflict and into post-conflict stabilisation operations. Engagement overseas also contributes to national prosperity, with UK training and equipment held in high regard by many nations, enabling sales on behalf of UK industry.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Our land forces are able to provide persistent security and protection to both people and places. Indeed, the most commonly employed component of peacekeeping and stabilisation missions are land forces because, as in war fighting, the objective is to compel a change in behaviour by government and people. In non-permissive circumstances, in addition to establishing a robust security framework (which for some force elements may entail more or less continuous combat), land forces may be required to contribute to wider stabilisation activities. When pursuing the gradual transition towards stability, commanders are likely to support the activities of other actors in protecting, strengthening and restoring civil society, governance, rule of law and the economy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces can support and assist state and non-state institutions, both at home and overseas. They provide a unique contribution in terms of personnel, command and control, equipment, experience, logistic capacity and access to isolated populations. As well as protecting the integrity of the UK’s coastal waters and airspace, there is a responsibility to assure the physical security of the homeland, on land. In certain circumstances, military aid to the civil authorities may be required beyond the deployment of very small numbers of highly-trained special forces. In an interconnected operating environment, where information is pervasive, threats overseas can rapidly migrate to the home base, requiring increased focus by our land forces in support of civil authorities on homeland resilience and security tasks. Away from home, typical activities include:
• peacekeeping;
• protection;
• providing essential services; and
• humanitarian assistance and disaster relief operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The ability of our land forces to fulfil the functions of land power cannot be taken for granted. Instead, the way in which UK land power is applied must be adapted according to the context in which it is employed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated action is the unifying doctrine which guides how land forces orchestrate and execute operations in an interconnected world, where the consequences of military action are judged by an audience that extends from immediate participants to distant observers. Integrated action embraces the joint and multinational context in which land power is employed, guiding land forces’ contribution to joint and multinational operations. It is at the divisional level that the commander and staff have the necessary skills, capacity and relationships with joint, allied and civilian actors to orchestrate integrated action in delivering any combination of the functions of land power (fight, engage, secure, support).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated action requires commanders and staff to be clear about the outcome they are seeking and to analyse the audience relevant for them to achieve their objectives. They then identify the effects that they wish to impart on that audience to achieve the outcome, and what capabilities and actions are available. These lethal and non-lethal capabilities may belong to the land force itself, or to external actors involved in the operation. It is important for commanders and staff to determine how to synchronise and orchestrate all the relevant levers to impart effects onto the audience to achieve the desired outcome.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated action has the audience as its major consideration. It requires sophisticated understanding, integration of all capabilities available, and is outcome-focused. These are the four fundamentals of the doctrine.
a. People are at the heart of conflict; it is their decisions and behaviours that determine how conflict is conducted and resolved. Integrated action requires consideration of the diverse audience that is relevant for us to achieve our objectives, globally, nationally and within theatres of operations, and includes friendly, neutral and enemy actors. The range of these audiences is illustrated at Figure 1.
b. Integrated action is founded on the land force’s understanding of its task, as well as the human, information and physical aspects of the environment in which they operate. They must also understand the context of a situation or conflict – including its historical, political, economic, cultural and social background – which shapes the resources and missions allocated to land forces, as well as their freedoms, constraints and relationships with other actors. Understanding is never complete. Rather, it evolves in response to our engagement with changing situations and improved knowledge. It is therefore essential for the force to learn throughout an operation, continually assessing its actions and those of others to generate dynamic and continuous understanding.
c. Land forces create desired effects by integrating lethal and non-lethal capabilities. Effective integration is, in turn, contingent on the cooperation and interoperability of the land force with multinational partners, and effective interaction with host nation, cross-government, non-governmental and inter-agency actors, as well as of tactical combined arms formations and units.
d. Integrated action needs commanders to think about how their actions contribute to the desired outcomes, in a broad and evolving context. Integrated action is planned from the desired outcome back to actions, through objectives and effects, and the execution is adjusted in response to what has been learned and the changing situation. This approach encourages a wider and longer-term view of a situation, relative to the task and role of the land force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Of joint operations to tactical formations, units and sub-units. There is, however, an important delineation between responsibilities for its orchestration and execution. Integrated action applies at all levels to land forces, from the land component
a. Integrated action can only be fully orchestrated and aligned with joint, inter-agency and multinational activity at the divisional level or above.
b. Brigades and units at the tactical level plan and execute a single tactical activity at a time, routinely integrating their own capabilities to contribute to an integrated action campaign orchestrated at the divisional level or above.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The two central ideas of land doctrine remain constant: the manoeuvrist approach and mission command. Together with integrated action, these form the intellectual foundation of UK land forces’ doctrine.
a. The manoeuvrist approach is the fighting doctrine of UK land forces. It determines the way we fight enemies across different types of operations, and because fighting can have extremely significant consequences, it is set in the broader context of the audience and integrated action. The manoeuvrist approach requires an attitude of mind that seeks indirect solutions, pits our strengths against enemy vulnerabilities to break the enemy’s will to
fight and to undermine their cohesion. We must therefore understand an enemy’s vulnerabilities, both before contact and as they appear and evolve during battle. This indirect approach emphasises the need to act in original ways unexpected by the enemy and a relentless determination to retain the initiative and exploit success. Seizing and holding the initiative allows our own forces to dictate the course of events, to decide and act before our opponents do and so gain advantage. The manoeuvrist approach also seeks to manipulate an enemy’s understanding to produce outcomes favourable to the friendly force. The perception of failure is the best mechanism by which to promote actual failure, convincing the enemy of the futility of their actions. The shock induced by surprise and an enemy’s loss of initiative all contribute to this perception of failure.
b. The exercise of command is the process by which commanders make decisions, impress their will on, and transmit their intentions to, subordinates. Common across Defence, our land forces adhere to the command philosophy of mission command. This is an approach which empowers subordinate commanders and promotes initiative as well as freedom and speed of action. It is based on mutual trust between leaders and those they lead. Leaders have a duty to provide the guidance, including a clearly defined intent, as well as the resources and constraints that allow subordinates to use their initiative and judgment. In return subordinates have a duty to act with loyalty and discipline to achieve that intent. Critically, it focuses on achieving the higher intent through mission-type orders. It empowers leaders at every level
and is intended to generate agility and tempo. This enables us to overcome an enemy in the most chaotic and demanding circumstances and unlocks everyone’s potential to seize winning opportunities, however fleeting. Supporting integrated action, mission command focuses on outcomes, objectives and effects, rather than specifying the detailed ways in which these are to be achieved.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Together, integrated action, the manoeuvrist approach and mission command form the fundamental ideas of UK land forces’ doctrine, providing the conceptual framework for applying UK land power. Army Doctrine Publication (ADP), Land Operations is the primary source of doctrine for UK land operations, and should be consulted by those seeking a more detailed explanation of the British Army’s practices and procedures.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The ability of our land forces to integrate with other organisations (military and non-military, within and external to Defence, and at home and overseas), underpins both joint and multinational operations. Military integration is referred to as interoperability. Our land forces face distinct challenges to achieving interoperability, including differing objectives, cultures, structures, equipment, laws and languages, as well as variations in doctrine, tactics, techniques, procedures and sustainment. Achieving high levels of interoperability takes time and resourcesto develop and maintain, and must be honed through training and by lessons identified during operations. Shared understanding improves interoperability, fusing information from a diverse range of organisations into a coherent whole.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A full spectrum approach to national power formalises an approach for dealing with the widest variety of challenges by creating and managing strategies to address complex problems. A full spectrum approach draws on a range of levers available to a state actor in a coordinated way to achieve (geo)political and strategic objectives. This can include overt and covert activities and military and non-military levers. It is designed to ensure that all possible ways and means (including those outside of direct Government control) that could be used to change or influence the behaviour of an opponent or competitor are considered before generating options and creating a strategy. Combining, coordinating and synchronising these capabilities reduces duplication, which leads to resource efficiencies and creates synergies. Land power, through integrated action, supports the UK’s full spectrum approach as part of a broader Defence contribution.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A national approach will usually be framed within a broader multinational and multi-agency response, involving many actors including allies, international organisations and non-governmental organisations. Alliances and coalitions provide a range of options that most nations could not generate independently, including unique capabilities or particular skills, as well as potentially providing the required mass for favourable force ratios. Participation in multinational operations can also enhance perceptions of legitimacy and increase influence across the international community. Maintaining cohesion across the international community is therefore a strategic priority in any multinational operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The term joint describes an operation or organisation in which elements of at least two Services participate. Joint task forces (JTFs) are created for specific operations, and usually exercise command through subordinate land, air, maritime, special forces and logistic components. The relationship between these components is synergistic; they each have unique strengths which combine to enhance the
ability of the joint force to accomplish a specific mission. Joint operations provide vital sustainment, projection and support, as well as intelligence gathering and the delivery of both lethal and non-lethal fires. Joint operations also significantly enhance options for freedom of manoeuvre and sustainment at speed and reach. A joint approach is therefore one of the foundations of UK Defence policy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Joint action is a framework for considering the integration, coordination and synchronisation of all military activity within the battlespace. The UK military contribution to a full spectrum approach is delivered through joint action, defined as: the deliberate use and orchestration of military capabilities and activities to create specific physical and/or psychological effects to influence a range of actors, including allies, civilian partners, regional and global audiences, as well as any adversary. Integrated action provides a doctrine for land forces that is completely compatible with joint action, yet adjusted for the characteristics of tactical land operations. Integrated action is effectively the land component’s contribution to joint action. The relationship between joint action and a full spectrum approach, within the context of an effective political strategy, is visualised at Figure <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Joint action coordinates and synchronises:
• fires (lethal and non-lethal, including through cyber and electromagnetic activities);
• information activities (including regional and key leader engagement);
• manoeuvre (used to gain advantage in time and space); and
• outreach (including stabilisation, support to governance and capacity building).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Land forces’ contribution to joint operations. Land forces execute a wide variety of missions, ranging from security tasks in support of stabilisation activities and reconstruction efforts to major combat operations. Simultaneously, they conduct various types of tactical activities, using fires and manoeuvre to apply overwhelming combat power, achieving decisive results, protecting the force, minimising civilian casualties, and facilitating future operations. Rarely will land, air, naval or special forces alone be capable of achieving the desired outcomes. Only effective mutual support in joint operations will achieve operational success. Land forces do, however, usually remain the decisive instrument by which an alliance or coalition can ultimately impose its will forcibly on any adversary. Depending upon the context, UK land forces are able to:
• integrate the effects of national instruments of power in the land environment;
• defeat enemy land forces;
• secure and hold terrain objectives, including access to areas of operations;
• directly influence the behaviours of conflict actors, in conjunction with other instruments of power;
• enable other Services, instruments of power, partners and agencies to operate, including through providing security, tactical understanding and interpersonal relationships;
• represent strong political commitment in support of national, alliance, coalition or bilateral objectives, complementary to other instruments of power;
• deter hostile and potentially hostile actors from aggression, as part of a credible and capable joint force;
• support the civil authorities in the provision of homeland resilience and security; and
• support conflict prevention and security improvement through persistent engagement and capacity building.

Understanding how the operational level of warfare provides the interface between the tactical and strategic levels of warfare is vital. Strategically, Defence is integral to our national security and directly supports our government’s policy objectives. The decision to commit our Armed Forces to operations rests with the Prime Minister, informed by the Cabinet and National Security Council, with advice from Secretary of State for Defence and Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). Parliament is normally consulted before military action, but such consultation may not always be possible. Decisions on Parliamentary handling will continue to be made at the discretion of the Prime Minister on a case-by-case basis. Parliamentary consultation should be factored into planning at an early stage.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Democratic control and political direction of our Armed Forces are exercised by Ministers, either individually or in committee. Desired outcomes are articulated as government policy, expressed as government intent in the form of a national strategic aim and translated into actionable objectives for across-government strategic planning. Ministers will decide on the approach for each situation, taking advice from a variety of across-government committees and the National Security Council.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As a military-strategic headquarters, the MOD’s Head Office plays an active part in supporting the National Security Council and developing the National Security Strategy and the associated Strategic Defence and Security Review outcomes. The Head Office’s role in directing operations and other military tasks is described in The New Operating Model – How Defence Works.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The National Security Council is the main forum for collective discussion of the government’s national security objectives and how best to deliver them. It integrates, at the highest level, the work of the departments of state and other parts of government contributing to national security. The National Security Council meets weekly and is chaired by the Prime Minister. It brings together all senior Ministers with an interest in national security, including the Secretary of State for Defence. As the government’s principal military adviser, CDS attends as required. The National Security Council is supported by National Security Council (Officials). The latter is chaired by the National Security Adviser.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Prime Minister and National Security Council, advised by the MOD and other government departments, set the strategic priorities for Defence and security. They also develop the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review. Together these documents set the government’s national security priorities and determine how they will be delivered – including identifying the contribution the government may ask Defence to make. They also provide the strategic direction to overseas operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The National Security Council determines policy and national strategic objectives through a process of political-strategic analysis. It also provides guidance for national planning. National strategic objectives are based upon the Prime Minister’s and Cabinet’s intent and draw on the framework of the National Security Strategy. National policy is then implemented through an integrated across- government strategy, coordinated through the Cabinet’s Overseas and Defence Secretariat (or another across-government body, as appropriate). Figure 1.1 shows how national strategy is developed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Policies dictate ends. Strategy determines the ways and means of achieving the ends. Together policy and strategy describe what needs to be achieved, how, and with what. A successful national strategy sets out a path, using the instruments of national power (diplomatic, economic and military, underpinned by information) to maintain political independence, achieve the long-term aims of the nation and/ or protect its vital interests. Figure 1.2 shows the key questions the government answers when determining a national strategy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Answering these questions (which may require involving other nations’ governments, international organisations and non-governmental organisations) should lead to a single, integrated whole-of-government strategy. Such an approach coordinates and synchronises the instruments of power. A lead department, acting on behalf of the government, will then:
• review, and where necessary, revise the policy outcome;
• assess progress and adjust priorities, across government, as necessary; and
• ensure the coherent and efficient use of national resources.
The current Defence Strategic Direction identifies the military tasks for Defence and directs our priorities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Political-strategic analysis. Political-strategic analysis comprises the across- government analysis of a crisis and options for its resolution. Political-strategic analysis can be led by any nominated department. However, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO), guided by routinely updated political-military estimates, usually leads on overseas policy including foreign security. Political-strategic analysis seeks to balance national priorities and resources in often complex and ambiguous circumstances. Any crisis is likely to be dynamic – and it will take time for political direction to evolve, especially where the UK intends to operate with other nations or multinational institutions (who may develop their responses at a different tempo). Consequently, a national response may take time to mature. Political-strategic analysis should provide:
• an understanding of the crisis situation;
• options open to the international community;
• options open to our government;
• how the UK may use its assets already in country or deploy additional assets; and
• any associated risks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Contending with ambiguity. Evolving direction can significantly increase pressure in terms of compressing planning and preparation time. This demands that political and military leaders have to contend with ambiguity at the very time that they seek certainty and reassurance. The fact that uncertainty will be the norm is an important insight and doctrine can only mitigate its disruptive impact to a certain extent. Understanding why political decision-making and strategic direction occur as they do can go some way to helping leaders deal with uncertainty.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National decision-making timelines. Decision-making timelines may be intentionally ill-defined. Political leaders may wish to test reactions (both home and abroad) to the inference, announcement or execution of a particular action before committing to more comprehensive involvement. A decision can be made to not agree upon a definitive long-term course of action from the outset. This acknowledges the adaptive nature of crises, with intervention from any quarter inevitably altering the dynamics between actors and altering the relevance and/ or viability of the objectives sought. Moreover, incremental decision-making may enable political leaders to manage risks with greater sophistication, making only those commitments that are necessary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms. Where a crisis affects multiple government departments, a collective response will be led by a nominated department (lead government department). Collective decision-making within central government is delivered through the Cabinet committee system; decision-making during emergencies follows the same pattern. Due to the unpredictable nature of crises, the government maintains dedicated crisis management facilities (Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms) which are only activated in the event of a major national emergency. The Prime Minister, Home Secretary or nominated senior Minister will chair key meetings involving Ministers and officials from relevant departments. Key external stakeholders may be invited to attend depending on the emergency. Meetings will cover all the strategic aspects of the response and recovery effort. Officials will identify options and provide advice to Ministers.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cabinet Office decision-making. Meetings within the Cabinet Office Briefing Rooms can be at a ministerial or official level and may be supported by:
• a situation cell which is responsible for ensuring that there is a single, immediate, authoritative overview of the current situation;
• communication and/or operations cells;
• an intelligence cell staffed by the intelligence agencies, Joint Terrorism
Analysis Centre, Defence Intelligence Staff and others as necessary;
• an impact management group or a recovery group; and
• the Joint Intelligence Committee.
The coalition context
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Multinationality is likely to be an enduring theme. The UK can commit military forces on alliance or coalition operations as the framework or lead nation, or as a contributing nation. Multinational operations may be:
• under NATO;
• UN-sponsored;
• NATO-based coalitions, which may include non-NATO partners (for example
Operation ALLIED FORCE, Kosovo, 1999) or Operation ELLAMY/UNIFIED
PROTECTOR, Libya, 2011);
• operations involving both the UN and NATO (Bosnia, 1995);
• EU operations (Bosnia from 2004, Darfur from 2006); or
• informal coalitions, such as the cooperation in Kosovo in 1999 between NATO
forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army, or in Afghanistan in 2002-03 between US forces and the Northern Alliance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
NATO’s operations doctrine. The NATO nations’ agreed framework for operations planning within, and by, the Alliance is contained in Military Committee document 133/4. The principles underpinning Alliance decision-making are addressed in NATO doctrine. Allied Joint Publication (AJP)-01, Allied Joint Doctrine considers the essential principles of Alliance doctrine at both the strategic and operational levels. It introduces the NATO operations planning system, the doctrine for which is covered in AJP-5, Allied Joint Doctrine for Operational-Level Planning. AJP-01 and AJP-5, along with AJP-3, Allied Joint Doctrine for the Conduct of Operations, are ratified for UK use. AJP-5 is complemented by the Allied Command Operations Comprehensive Operations Planning Directive (COPD). This document articulates the NATO strategic and operational-level planning processes. It supports the NATO crisis management process and should be used by operations planners. This publication should complement, not substitute, this NATO higher level doctrinal and procedural guidance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Multinational decision-making. Decision-making between nations involved in a multinational operation will be more complicated than in a purely national context. Consensus-building can be both complex and time-consuming. While the logic of establishing shared understanding and common goals across coalitions may be sound, the reality is complicated by political, doctrinal, interoperability and legal considerations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Motives. The reasons why nations, groups and individuals choose to engage in a coalition, or to adopt a particular stance, will reflect a combination of factors. These include commitment to collective responsibility, self-interest, fear, self-preservation, shared values and beliefs, efficiency, and humanitarian concern. National troop contributions are often determined by the anticipated political benefits that such commitment brings. Those involved will have differing motivations and perceptions of the situation. These differences may cause ambiguity, mistrust and delay.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Unity of purpose. When we intend to act with other nations the outcome sought should be agreed between nations (accepting the time and complexity involved and (potentially) the reduced clarity of the outcome). At the very least, national perspectives should be harmonised to unify individual national efforts. While negotiation and consensus-building may need to precede agreement, some form of broadly-agreed desired outcome remains an essential start point for further planning. Formal direction must follow, delivered through national chains of command. In the interim, military preparations and some nations’ preliminary operations may already have started. Outside a formal alliance, achieving unity of command on a multinational operation may be politically challenging, but should be the goal. Where unity of command is unachievable, a multinational operation should strive for harmonisation of effort.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Benefits and challenges. In multinational operations, nations have to balance the collective objectives of the alliance or coalition with their own respective national goals. The commitment by multiple nations to contribute military forces to accomplish agreed goals brings three advantages:
• increased political strength and enhanced legitimacy across the international community;
• shared risk and cost; and
• increased military capability and effectiveness – perhaps the most difficult to
exploit to full advantage due to interoperability challenges.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Secretary of State for Defence. The Secretary of State for Defence heads the MOD and is responsible for all defence matters as well as providing strategic direction, endorsing resource allocation and setting the constraints on the use of force. Force levels and rules of engagement are subject to policy decisions that will be made by Ministers, taking into account legal advice. CDS, Vice Chief of the Defence Staff (VCDS) and the Permanent Under Secretary are responsible for providing advice to Ministers to inform these decisions. These decisions are recorded in a CDS Planning Directive.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Defence Crisis Management Organisation. The Defence Crisis Management Organisation (DCMO) coordinates input from the Chiefs of Staff Committee, Head Office, Joint Forces Command, Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ), Director Special Forces and the single-Service commands. The DCMO is the focus for providing Defence advice within the government’s overall management and resolution of crises. It provides the conduit for all briefings to Ministers and directs and monitors deployed commands. This is shown in Figure 1.3 (over).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Chief of the Defence Staff. Following the Secretary of State for Defence’s direction, CDS (as the military strategic commander) is responsible for the planning, direction and conduct of all military operations. CDS, advised by the VCDS (their deputy for operational matters) and the single-Service Chiefs, is responsible for formulating the military strategy and making sure it is coherent with government policy. Through a CDS Operation’s Directive, CDS:
• appoints the operational commander;
• provides strategic direction;
• identifies the military conditions for success;
• designates the theatre and joint operations area;
• specifies forces levels and resources;
• promulgates the constraints on the use of force; and • sets the strategic defence intelligence requirements.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The single-Service chiefs. Both individually, and through the Chiefs of Staff Committee, the single-Service Chiefs provide advice to the CDS on how to conduct current and future operations. In particular, they advise on how their Service could be employed to best effect.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Head Office. This Office supports CDS and the Chiefs of Staff Committee in:
• developing policy-informed military advice for Ministers on current and potential military operations;
• directing the military chain of command;
• ensuring the conduct of the operation reflects the Secretary of State’s
direction; and
• ensuring the conduct of the operation is consistent with wider government policy.
The Head Office focuses on the strategic level. It defines the ways in which military force will help achieve our government’s ends (its current and future security objectives) and determines the military means required to deliver them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Strategic outcome. The term strategic outcome describes our aim and strategic objectives for a particular crisis. How we articulate it will vary depending on:
• the nature of the crisis;
• the nature of the intended response (with varying degrees of emphasis on the diplomatic, economic and military instruments of power); and
• the extent of collaboration envisaged with other nations, multinational institutions and international organisations.
A strategic outcome evolves over time, its definition and detail increasing as a crisis unfolds. Assumptions are inevitable and military commanders must ensure that assumptions are revalidated and military activity adjusted as required. Assumptions:
• play an important part in strategic planning;
• inform initial planning and how the commander envisages change;
• ensure that long-term contingency planning is not delayed while waiting for definitive planning guidance; and
• must be recorded for future reference when validating planning.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Political-military estimate. The MOD helps inform national strategy by conducting a political-military estimate. The political-military estimate is seldom neatly-bounded from the outset. Rather, the political-military estimate develops over time with the across-government political strategic analysis and the continuing national and international political dialogue. Although it is MOD-led, key representation from the Cabinet Office and other government departments contribute to the process. The political-military estimate considers potential crisis areas around the world and assesses political implications against military feasibility and sustainability. It makes a vital contribution to:
• political-strategic analysis;
• developing national strategy; and
• any decision to initiate a CDS Planning Directive (as shown in Figure 1.1).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military strategy. Military strategy is a subset of Defence strategy. It directs the use of the military instrument where it has been identified by the Government as part of a UK response to a specific challenge. Military strategy is a strategic headquarters function, owned by CDS and led on his behalf by Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Military Strategy and Operations). Specifically, the aim of military strategy is to ensure coherent and effective strategic planning when using our Armed Forces. Military strategy is inherently joint. It also sits above single-Service interests, tying together military capabilities to deliver an effect that meets the short-term requirement, but is firmly rooted in a clear understanding of the long-term policy ends. Military strategy has a role to play in developing policy through delivering military advice including, ultimately, the advice delivered by CDS to the Prime Minister. It should respond to the requirements asked of it by politicians and policy- makers, but should also offer up options in support of the Government’s ambitions. Importantly, military strategy must, at all times, be rooted in Defence strategy and policy. Operational policy staffs are embedded within the military strategy function to ensure that planning and operational delivery take place within the boundaries defined by policy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National strategic aim. Figure 1.4 shows how the instruments of power combine towards the national strategic aim. The UK’s strategic aim is the Government’s declared purpose in a particular situation. It is normally expressed in terms of reaching a future desired outcome. The UK’s strategic aim may be articulated by Ministers, determined from UK foreign policy statements and official records, or through discussions between politicians and officials. Achieving the national strategic aim requires across-government and multiple agency contributions. The national strategic aim provides the unifying purpose and strategic narrative for military and non-military leaders and organisations. The ability to influence participants involved in a crisis, rather than simply to intervene or act in a given situation, is critical to achieving the national strategic aim. For this reason, a national information strategy will normally be formulated by the across-government Information Strategy Group. The national information strategy articulates policy, desired outcomes and the strategic narrative to which all government departments must work. It includes the themes and messages to be communicated and the specific actions to be conducted. In multinational operations, the national information strategy must be nested within that of the Alliance or coalition.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National strategic objectives. A national strategic objective is a goal to be achieved through one or more instruments of national power to meet the national strategic aim. It may be explicit, or deduced from government policy, strategic direction or the decisions of the National Security Council. Strategic objectives are likely to require significant coordination across inter-governmental, international and departmental boundaries, even if allocated to a particular department to lead. In practice, formulating strategic objectives by consensus may be challenging. The process should be coordinated centrally, for example, through the Cabinet or National Security Council. Figure 1.4 also shows the diplomatic and economic contributions alongside the military contribution. Of note, the NATO definition of objective is ‘..a clearly defined and attainable goal for a military operation’. UK commanders and planners in NATO operations must appreciate the distinction between our national and NATO’s use of the term.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military contribution to the national strategic aim and national strategic objectives. The military strategic end-state is the extent of the military contribution to meeting the national strategic aim and objectives. The military contribution must align with the diplomatic and economic contributions towards the same national strategic aim.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military strategic objectives. The extent of the military contribution to the national strategic aim should be expressed in terms of military strategic objectives. Military strategic objectives may be discrete, support, or be supported by, other departments or agencies. Military strategic objectives both define and limit the military commitment. They are developed from one or more military response options. Once all objectives are achieved, this indicates the conclusion of the military effort (noting that others may remain involved long after security has been re-established). The military commitment may also be redefined to meet revised aims. Within the resources and constraints assigned to him, a Joint Force Commander (JFC) is responsible for achieving these military strategic objectives. JFCs attain their military strategic objectives through one or more operations, each with specified operations objectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Turning military strategic objectives into an operations plan. The aim of all crisis management activity is to reach a desired outcome. However, direct correlation between objectives being achieved and a desired outcome being reached (favourable conditions ‘having been’ created) should not be taken as given when planning. This is because:
• crises are complex and that makes them inherently unpredictable;
• the effects, or conditions cannot always be created as desired and, even if created as intended, may not always generate the desired outcome and may create others;
• the desired outcome may be reached without the identified objectives being achieved;
• while the foreseen consequences of activities, whether desirable or not,
can be planned for (and associated risks duly managed) the unforeseen
consequences cannot;
• crises are not amenable to precise management or control;
• conditions exist, or not, as a result of a myriad of factors and influences; and
• while commanders may be expected to achieve realistic objectives, they cannot necessarily create specific conditions on the ground.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Turning military 
The national strategic aim is the government’s declared purpose in a particular situation, normally expressed in terms of reaching a future desired outcome. In a NATO context this would be coincident with, or contribute to, the NATO desired end-state. (End-state: the political and/or military situation to be attained at the end of an operation, which indicates that the objective has been achieved.) (AAP-06) The desired outcome is a favourable and enduring situation, consistent with political direction, reached through intervention or as a result of some other form of influence. It invariably requires contributions from all instruments of power; it should be determined collectively. The national strategic aim provides the unifying purpose for strategic- and operational-level commanders, and leaders from non-military organisations. A national strategic objective is a goal to be achieved by one or more instruments of national power to meet the national strategic aim. In a NATO context these would be coincident with, or contribute to, NATO strategic objectives. Military strategy is that component of national or multinational strategy, presenting the manner in which military power should be applied to achieve national objectives or those of a group of nations. (AAP-06). The military strategic end-state is the extent of the military contribution to meeting the national strategic aim, expressed as a series of military strategic objectives. Military strategic objectives are goals to be achieved by the military to meet the national strategic aim (and are the responsibility of the military-strategic commander (CDS)). NATO uses the same term; the NATO military strategic objectives are derived from the strategic objectives and ‘owned’ by the Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR). An objective is a clearly defined and attainable goal for a military operation, for example seizing a terrain feature, neutralizing an adversary’s force or capability or achieving some other desired outcome that is essential to a commander’s plan and towards which the operation is directed (AAP-06).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operations objectives. The relationship between military strategic objectives and contributory operations objectives is important. Operations objectives relate to a single theatre of operations and are ‘owned’ by the respective JFC. While JFCs may achieve their assigned objectives, other contributions may be required to achieve the desired outcome. These include strategic-level contributions made by forces retained under the command of the military strategic commander. On a larger scale, achieving military strategic objectives may require a number of JFCs, in different theatres, to complete their respective operations objectives. Multinational operations add a further level of complexity to the process of developing operations objectives. This complexity can be mitigated by trusted partnerships founded on common doctrine, training and experience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military strategic direction. Operations design at the operational level is initiated by a CDS’ planning directive, which is issued to the Joint Commander (normally the Chief of Joint Operations (CJO)). Once the Prime Minister decides to commit military resources, CDS’ Operations Directive provides authority to conduct operations. Annexes 1A and 1B are illustrative examples of CDS’ Planning and Operation’s Directives – they are for guidance only and can be modified as described. Small deployments or tasks should not require every aspect of the directives to be completed; operational staff work must always be concise.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Strategic communication. Strategic communication is defined as: advancing national interests by using all Defence means of communication to influence the attitudes and behaviours of people. It is primarily a philosophy, partly a capability and partly a process. Philosophy is the key element since it underpins aligning words, images and actions to realise influence. The CDS’ Planning and Operations Directives will articulate the desired information effect to the JFC, who will deliver the operational-level military contribution as part of the wider across-government strategic communication for an operation. This should be articulated through a strategic narrative or, where extra focus is required, a MOD departmental narrative from which JFCs will derive their key themes and messages. Themes provide an overarching concept or intention, designed for broad communication, while messages comprise narrowly focused communication directed at a specific target audience. In this way JFCs ensure that strategic communication can be supported by the deeds of the joint task force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The operational level is: the level of operations at which campaigns and major operations are planned, conducted and sustained to accomplish strategic objectives within theatres or areas of operations. The scale and level of command at the operational level is not pre-defined but should assume a size and shape that meets the demands of the operation. Depending on the operation type and scale, the operational level could be at component command. The operational level is therefore best defined by function. The operational level provides the link and gearing between strategic objectives and the tactical employment of forces. Without this link, it is unlikely that tactical actions will lead to achieving the desired end-state. Activities must be linked by the operational level to the aims of the overall strategy, but the strategy should also be linked through the operational level to what is tactically realistic; this is operations design.
 <|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The main activities within operations design are analysis and planning. Analysis is continuous. Operations planning is initiated if a major contingency is anticipated, or a change to an existing plan is required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Analysis. Before embarking on an operational-level planning process, a Joint Force Commander (JFC) requires a thorough and up-to-date understanding of the strategic context. The process of analysis, underpinned by intelligence, informs the JFC who then applies their reasoning and judgment to develop and execute military operations. Understanding is crucial; it provides insight and foresight on what can, and cannot, be influenced, and where the boundaries lie.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Planning. Planning must answer three questions:
• what are the features of the current (crisis) situation;
• what should the (more favourable) situation look like at the end; and
• how should the situation change or be changed?
Planning addresses how to attain specified objectives designed to contribute to close the gap between the current situation and the desired outcome. Achieving the end-state is not a discrete activity, but rather it is nested within a broader framework.
a. Military actions (to realise specific effects and subsequently attain objectives) are frequently inter-woven with the actions, intended effects, and associated objectives of other non-military actors. Whether or not such inter-dependencies are reflected in formal supporting and supported relationships, participants are unlikely to be entirely effective without coordination and cooperation.
b. Operations planning links strategic ends with tactical action. Ends and action are dynamic and subject to:
• the constraints and urgencies of time;
• changes in political intent and strategic priorities (potentially spanning a number of concurrent operations) which influence an operation from above; and
• changes in the tactical situation (including correlating forces) which influence an operation from below.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Collaborative planning. JFCs will have to synchronise their work with that of other nations, commanders, headquarters, departments and agencies. JFCs should consult to get their views and conduct initial planning early to inform subsequent discussions. Collaborative planning is more effective when a commander and all planning contributors are physically collocated. This encourages full participation, detailed negotiation, and the timely and equitable consideration of all points of
view. The understanding stage must involve the commander. Thereafter, where commanders themselves cannot participate personally, then trusted and empowered representatives should act on their behalf to maintain momentum.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Planning doctrine and processes. Operations design is outlined in Allied Joint Publication (AJP)-01, Allied Joint Doctrine. The doctrine for operational-level planning is addressed in AJP-5, Allied Joint Doctrine for Operational-Level Planning (with national green text) and the necessary processes in the Comprehensive Operations Planning
Directive (COPD). AJP-5 contains:
• an overview of NATO planning;
• doctrine on operational art and design within operational-level planning; and
• detail on conducting the operational-level planning process including the
operational-level estimate. The COPD provides:
• an overview of NATO crisis management and planning;
• procedures on developing situational awareness;
• the planning process at the NATO strategic level;
• the planning process at the operational level;
• operations assessment; and
• all relevant formats.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
AJP-5’s operational-level planning process nests within the NATO crisis management process described in the COPD. Figure 2.1 (on the next page) shows these linkages.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
UK commitment to multinational operations. Multinational operations are normally facilitated by selecting a lead or framework nation, in many cases under the mandate of the UN or other recognised international organisation. However, multilateral planning may have no specified lead nation, particularly when nations’ levels of commitment have yet to be determined. When the UK is considering whether to contribute to a multinational operation, the MOD provides advice on the level of any UK military commitment, and the associated military strategic objectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Permanent Joint Headquarters in multinational operations. Chief of Defence (CDS) delegates operational command (OPCOM) of UK forces to a nominated UK Joint Commander (normally Commander Joint Operations (CJO)). CJO may further delegate operational control (OPCON), tactical command (TACOM) or tactical control (TACON) to a subordinate UK or multinational commander.
a. UK-led operations. When the UK is the lead/framework nation, Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) forms the nucleus of the multinational headquarters, augmented as necessary by staff from other participating nations. The UK also provides staff to form the nucleus of a deployed multinational Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ).
b. Non UK-led operations. When the UK is not the lead or framework nation, CJO acts as UK coordinator of supporting command functions and coordinates the activities of the single-Services and the Joint Forces Command in deploying, sustaining and recovering UK forces assigned to the operation. CJO may also provide staff from PJHQ to a multinational headquarters and will specify national caveats.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Joint Force Commander in multinational operations. To understand the effect JFC’s actions may have on coalition cohesion, they must know the terms and conditions under which other nations contingents have been provided. CJO, acting as the coordinator of supporting command functions, should ensure that multinational objectives complement those of the UK and that the proposed UK contribution is feasible within available capabilities. Other nations’ liaison officers based at PJHQ, and reciprocal UK liaison officers based abroad, provide valuable links with other nations’ military planning headquarters.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
When the UK contributes to NATO crisis response, the process described in Section 2 (crisis response planning) is applied. This ensures that the UK’s participation accords with the government’s intent and timely contributions are made to NATO planning.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The MOD is responsible for liaising on strategic issues, both with NATO Headquarters (through the UK Military Representative and with Supreme Allied Commander Europe (SACEUR) located at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe (SHAPE). SHAPE also functions as Allied Command Operations (ACO).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Defence Crisis Management Organisation (DCMO) will respond to, and proactively support, the NATO planning process. DCMO will support the North Atlantic Council (NAC) early in its considerations, prior to issuing the activation warning and in such a way that the UK’s intended participation is made clear before NATO confirms its force generation plans. A strategic planning group/current commitments team is likely to be the principal vehicle through which the UK contributes to NATO planning and responds to force preparation, transfer of authority and activation order instructions. PJHQ is responsible for coordinating operational matters with SHAPE, the Allied Joint Force Commands and with deployed UK forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Command and control arrangements are specified in the concept of operations which will detail the conditions for transfer of authority from national to NATO command. SACEUR will normally delegate OPCON to an appointed JFC once the force is constituted. In turn, SACEUR, may sub-delegate OPCON based on operational requirements.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Doctrine. Doctrine varies between nations, although the UK intent is to work within a recognised multinational planning framework wherever possible (the COPD) and employ NATO doctrine. Even when common doctrine is used, there will be differences in interpretation and application. Commanders and planning staff must ensure these differences are identified and addressed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Influencing, and being influenced by, allies. Staffs acting in multinational roles can be expected to represent their nations’ interests.
a. National interest. UK commanders and staff should represent and promote the national interest, either as an explicit planning priority or objective or, more generally in shaping multinational intent. They should expect other nations’ representatives to do the same.
b. Unique capabilities. The UK may be asked to contribute unique capabilities or particular staff skills, which should be exploited fully. Other nations will also possess capabilities that the UK may desire.
c. National caveats. UK JFCs and staff should seek to develop trust and close working relationships with other national representatives. While there is a tendency to adopt the norms and standards of a surrounding culture, they should always act within UK national guidelines. It is preferable to be frank about national caveats or other reservations and to seek out areas where the UK’s positive contribution could benefit the multinational force. If in doubt, UK JFCs and their staff should seek national guidance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Multinational cohesion. Maintaining cohesion across the international community is a strategic priority in any multinational operation. It builds and maintains operations authority and increases the likelihood of future force contributions. Cohesion must be monitored as part of operations assessment and JFCs must devote significant time and effort to building and maintaining partnerships and trust.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Multi-agency planning. Within an integrated approach, commanding military forces does not necessarily confer command or control of the overall situation. Where control is vested in another government department, JFCs should support coordinated planning with military advice and contribute to the collective execution of the overall mission. They should also consider the impact of having to assume responsibility for some, or all, of the non-military lines of operation if the security or political situation precludes delivery by other agencies or authorities. The resource implications of such a contingency may be significant and JFCs should be prepared to prioritise their efforts accordingly.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Departmental processes and cultures. Each department will have differing timelines, planning capacity, priorities, culture and approach to risk. It should not be assumed that a military approach will be universally acceptable or understood and this may introduce frictions, misunderstandings and uncertainties. Annex 2A outlines Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Department for International Development and Stabilisation Unit practices and culture. In the early stages of an operation, where conditions are non- or semi-permissive, the military will often be the principal contributor. When giving advice, commanders must use plain, jargon-free language and recognise that certain words can be laden with hidden meaning and values. Where command and control arrangements are unclear, commanders should be prepared to coordinate activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Multi-agency leadership. An integrated response is most likely to succeed if a single figure, ideally formally empowered, orchestrates the activities of all the agencies involved. How the role is agreed, and the formal authority that the leader is granted, varies on a case-by-case basis. For UK national operations, an ambassador or political appointee, or a military commander, may be appropriate. In multinational operations undertaken by the UN, the Special Representative of the Secretary General is likely to be appointed the leader. On other occasions, particularly where there is no single nation or international organisation orchestrating events, other mechanisms may generate the required leadership. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Across-government bodies. Departmental coordination within the UK is enhanced through across-governmental bodies, often facilitated by the Cabinet Office, with both strategic and operational responsibilities. These include:
• facilitating inter-departmental strategic planning to develop strategies and policies to deal with specific crises; 
• coordinating departmental contributions to the across-government strategy and monitoring national progress; and
• providing liaison and coordination for JFCs and other government departments in theatre.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated planning at the operational level. There is no universal template for collaborative planning between military and non-military organisations at the operational level. The processes are dictated by the nature of the situation, the variety of actors and the extent of their involvement. Figure 2.2 (on the next page) illustrates possible variations in inter-departmental collaboration, using three illustrative scenarios in which the military act:
• alone (A);
• in loose cooperation with other government departments as part of a multi- agency operation (B); or
• with close inter-agency collaboration under a unified across-government plan developed by the controlling department (C). While all three models envisage a single national strategy, military planning may be developed in relative isolation from other departments (A), or in coordination with them (B); or subordinate to an agreed across-government strategy (C).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
International and non-governmental organisations. The UK needs to coordinate and harmonise its military actions with those of other agencies, including international organisations, non-governmental organisations, donors and regional organisations. The onset of operations usually acts as a catalyst for coordination under either loose, or more formalised, frameworks. The UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (UN OCHA) normally establishes a humanitarian operations (or coordination) centre in any humanitarian crisis. UN agencies and non-governmental organisations attend coordination meetings hosted by UN OCHA, but there may be other non-governmental organisation forums where stakeholders address common issues and concerns.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Humanitarian organisations. Commanders must understand the different needs and perspectives of humanitarian organisations. Each is likely to have a distinctive culture and unique aim, and some may not accept coordination with/by military forces (or even to be seen to cooperate with them). Each organisation should be treated separately, requiring an individual approach, and JFCs may need to adopt unfamiliar working practices to facilitate collaboration. They should aim to create a broad dialogue, seek advice and benefit from the expertise and insights of different organisations. Many organisations may have been in a particular operating environment for years and have unique and valuable experience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Inter-agency collaboration. There is no template by which JFCs may support an integrated approach. Figure 2.3 offers three models.
a. Predominantly inter-agency. Greatest collaboration is achieved where the majority of national and multinational partners work to an agreed strategic plan, ideally with an empowered leader. Some agencies may remain unwilling or unable to operate in this way and aspects of inter-agency working remain challenging.
b. Multi-agency and inter-agency. Unity of purpose is achieved through inter-agency working, where military and other government department staffs establish long-term collaborative practices. Such arrangements may be self-established or prescribed. This approach is enhanced by collocation. Multinationality, and the presence of international organisations and non- governmental organisations, makes this approach more demanding and therefore, ideally requires common procedures to be adopted.
c. Multi-agency. At the lowest level of collaboration, JFCs coordinate with other government departments, multinational partners, international organisations and non-governmental organisations. In such circumstances, an integrated approach is enabled through civil-military cooperation, without establishing firm relationships. This approach allows coordination or de-confliction, but does not enable a collaborative approach with agreed outcomes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Private military and security companies. At an early stage, JFCs should consider the impact of private military and security companies on their actions and operations. Most of these companies are multinational and provide a range of armed and unarmed services. This includes:
• risk management;
• governance and development activities;
• security provision;
• force and close protection; and
• military training to government, corporate and non-governmental organisation clients.
JFCs should consider coordinating, or at least de-conflicting, their actions, with such companies.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Contractor support to operations. This is an increasingly important element in the overall provision of support to operations. It is addressed in JDP 4-00, Logistics for Joint Operations and AJP-3.13, Allied Joint Doctrine for the Deployment of Forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Defence Crisis Management Organisation. The MOD’s DCMO conducts three types of planning to support both national and multinational operations.
a. Crisis response planning determines, often at short notice, an appropriate military response to a current or imminent crisis.
b. Contingency planning is based on a mixture of intelligence and assumptions addressing how our Armed Forces might be involved in future crises. This does not imply an endorsed intent by the government. It may be impractical to gauge the likelihood of a contingency plan being enacted. However, where resources need to be expended to reduce or mitigate risk, the potential impact of a crisis must be assessed to inform prioritisation.
c. Current operations planning manages a current operation, prevents escalation and sustains military activity. Such planning tends to follow crisis response planning, when military activity is (or is envisaged to be) prolonged. It may also involve elements of contingency planning to address potential changes in the situation, when we think we may be reaching a desired, or acceptable, outcome.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Crisis management groups. Crises can impact across government, and a variety of task-organised, multifunctional groups monitor both potential and emerging crises. These groups will plan and manage crisis response through to its end. Annex 2B describes the principal crisis management groups (with their detailed procedures being covered in DCMO standing operating procedures.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Planning context. Figure 2.4 shows planning in an across-government context. It shows how actions contribute to effects that lead to achieving decisive conditions that support operations objectives. These actions are undertaken by diplomatic and economic contributors, not just the military. Actions by any contributor can have both anticipated and unanticipated effects on other contributors’ intended effects – few contributors exist in isolation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
NATO or coalition context. When we operate in a NATO or coalition context, diplomatic and economic contributions will be planned and executed by all contributing nations. Therefore, JFCs may have to contend with more than just other nations’ military actions. As a coalition increases in diversity, the chances of unintended (negative or positive) consequences on others’ intended effects will increase. Also in theatre will be multiple other actors whose actions and inactions may also impact on the JFC’s plan. This complexity places great emphasis on the closest possible collaborative planning from the outset and from the highest levels downwards. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Crisis response planning, summarised in Annex 2C, requires agility to cope with uncertainty, ambiguity and change. Appendix 2C1 gives guidance on how the principal actors interact dynamically to produce the major planning outputs required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Political-military estimate and political strategic analysis. A crisis can arise, or change in nature or seriousness, at short notice. Alternatively, a crisis may develop slowly, with time for a current operations group to form and deliberate (allowing contingency planning to occur). In a NATO context, this period is addressed in Phase 1 of the NATO crisis management process. The MOD engages in across- government political strategic analysis (see Chapter 1) to consider options for how the UK might respond (a political decision, ultimately for the Prime Minister, the Cabinet and the National Security Council). In the case of a rapidly emerging crisis, an early political-military estimate, conducted by a nominated strategic planning group, is used to identify possible (but as yet unformulated) desirable outcomes. It will also evaluate potential military response options and associated risks, for consideration by the Director of Operations  and the CDS. In a NATO context, planning will be initiated by a strategic warning order. This will be initiated by direction from the North Atlantic Council SACEUR to conduct a strategic assessment. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Chief of Defence Staff’s planning directive. Having conducted the political- military estimate, and subject to the outcome of the political strategic analysis, the strategic planning group drafts CDS’ planning directive (see Chapter 1 and Annex 1A) to start the military-strategic estimate. In the early stages, guidance to planners may be:
• heavily-caveated;
• based on multiple assumptions; and
• liable to change as circumstances and political choices mature.
CDS’ intent, articulated within their planning directive, provides a unifying function for those engaged in concurrent, but potentially discrete, planning activities across the DCMO. Planners may need to make assumptions to maintain planning momentum and confirm or update them as the situation evolves. Broad environmental and functional contributions from the outset enable comprehensive and concurrent planning. For PJHQ to progress the military-strategic estimate, a planning directive is issued as early as possible. It provides: strategic direction (either in draft or final form); assumptions and constraints; and planning direction. In a NATO context, strategic assessment, followed by developing military response options, will result in SACEUR producing their strategic planning directive. This forms part of the strategic plan development phase. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military-strategic estimate. On receiving CDS’ planning directive, a military- strategic estimate is conducted by the PJHQ contingency planning team with the MOD’s Strategic Planning Group and Current Commitments Team. Inputs to this process include:
• CDS’ planning directive;
• a summary of the political-military estimate;
• outputs from across-government planning; and • the National Information Strategy.
In a NATO context, further inputs may include:
• the strategic and operational warning orders;
• SACEUR’s strategic assessment;
• draft military response options;
• A North Atlantic Council Initiating Directive with Military Committee
guidance; and
• SACEUR’s strategic planning directive.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Scope. The military-strategic estimate scopes the feasibility of a military contribution to crisis response and evaluates options for submission to Ministers. The military-strategic estimate:
• uses techniques such as illustrative operations planning, risk analysis and operational analysis to test options.
• provides a critical opportunity for military planners to indicate to political decision-makers how events might unfold, what forces may be required (and the opportunity costs involved in their committal), what casualties might result, financial costs, and prospects of success or failure.
• should be periodically revisited during operations, including during multinational operations where the UK may not have the lead in planning but may be able to exert influence based upon rigorous analysis.
A summary of the military-strategic estimate, briefed through the Chiefs of Staff Committee, is used by the Secretary of State and CDS to advise Cabinet on the practicality and implications, immediate and longer term, of a military contribution to any response. Identifying and communicating strategic risk is an important element of the military-strategic estimate process.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Chief of Defence Staff’s Operation’s Directive. When the Prime Minister decides to commit military forces, CDS issues detailed direction by means of a CDS Operation’s Directive drafted by a current commitments team (see Chapter 1 and Annex 1B). It includes three main elements.
a. Strategic direction comprising: national strategic aim; national strategic objectives; military strategic end-state and military strategic objectives; strategic narrative and information effect; CDS’ intent; and any constraints at the operational level.
b. Force composition and conduct which identifies the elements of the
joint force, designates the theatre of operations, and provides guidance on anticipated duration, sustainability and any legal issues including rules of engagement. The operations directive may also outline strategic risks identified by the military strategic headquarters, and any threats or opportunities these may present at the operational level.
c. Command and control issues including:
• command appointments;
• command relationships;
• guidance on coordination with all parties; and
• command and control arrangements.
CDS may issue an Operation’s Directive (either draft or initial) on a limited distribution before all information is available and may also delegate the development of certain sections, such as coordinating instructions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Joint Commander’s mission directive. CDS will nominate a Joint Commander; this is normally the Chief of Joint Operations (CJO). The Joint Commander, with authority from CDS planning and operations directives, issues a Joint Commander’s Directive to empower JFCs and direct the enabling functions of deploy, sustain and recover. Annex 2D is representative of such a directive.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Collaborative planning. Crisis planning takes place collaboratively between the MOD, CJO, PJHQ and the assigned JFC. Liaison officers should be exchanged between JFCs, planning entities, contributing components, the Stabilisation Unit and other government departments who have been involved in planning. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Planning the deployment. Planning for deploying the force, including headquarters and augmentees, should begin at the earliest opportunity. This enables JFCs to:
• identify any constraints;
• establish the broad deployment timeline;
• meet the lead times for chartering aircraft and ships; and
• conduct wider engagement with industry.
Deployment planning should remain covert until an announcement has been made to commit forces, and must always be subject to operations security. PJHQ orchestrates force deployment, although the JFC’s headquarters will shape much of the planning to ensure that it meets the JFC’s intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Planning the military operation. Operations planning in support of any integrated across-government or multinational planning may be completed before deployment planning begins, but they frequently overlap (catered for by JFHQ participation in PJHQ’s contingency planning team and the establishment of a situational awareness group). A planning sequence is described below.
a. From the outset, JFHQ staff branches are represented on PJHQ’s contingency planning team. This keeps JFCs informed on progress and they will also represent the JFC’s views at the strategic/operational interface. JFCs will begin to formulate their plans in parallel with the contingency planning team, and they may issue a warning order.
b. JFCs and/or members of their staff may conduct a reconnaissance to theatre, normally as part of an operational liaison reconnaissance team. The Joint Commander should outline the aim of such reconnaissance and any constraints, such as duration, limits on movement and liaison authority. The exact nature, size and duration of the reconnaissance party may vary, but it should include allies or coalition partners, potential host nations and other government departments.
c. JFCs undertake operational-level planning in collaboration with subordinate commanders, other government departments, international organisations, non-governmental organisation representatives and coalition partners. To ensure that the most recent information and assumptions are available to all planning teams, there should be a continuous exchange of information between strategic, operational and tactical headquarters.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Relationship with the operational liaison and reconnaissance team. A deployed operational liaison reconnaissance team may satisfy information and intelligence requirements emerging from both the military-strategic estimate and the operational estimate. It may also generate new issues for clarification up the chain-of-command. An operational liaison reconnaissance team may remain in place and form the core of the JFC’s deployed headquarters.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Contingency planning addresses potential military involvement in future crises (see Appendix 2C1). The Strategic Regional Implementation Group for Defence Engagement (STRIDE) highlights intelligence collection requirements and areas of potential instability that are likely to affect UK interests. To reduce the time taken to produce detailed plans in the event of a crisis, CDS directs CJO to develop contingency plans in the form of generic joint planning guides and more specific joint contingency plans.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Joint planning guides comprise generic planning data for a country, region or theatre, or for the military contribution to a particular type of operation, such as a non-combatant evacuation operation or a disaster relief operation. MOD, PJHQ, the single-Service Chiefs, Joint Forces Command or other government departments may identify a need for a joint planning guide; this requires CJO approval. If approved, the following steps are taken.
• CJO instructs PJHQ J5 to compile the planning guide, outlining the planning parameters, likely objectives, timelines and any political or military constraints.
• PJHQ will form a contingency planning team who identify any other government department or Stabilisation Unit plans for that area.
• A reconnaissance may be conducted with the British military representative, or military intelligence liaison officer, and any other government department representatives in theatre. Joint planning guide reconnaissance is normally carried out discreetly by a small team.
• Once the reconnaissance is finished, the contingency planning team circulates a draft joint planning guide for comment by other government departments, proposed supporting commands, and relevant Embassies/High Commissions via the Consular Division of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.
• Once all comments have been incorporated, and the joint planning guide has been approved by CJO, it is maintained by PJHQ.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Joint contingency plans detail the military capabilities needed to conduct specified operations and deployment options, and include readiness states and associated risks. The requirement for a joint contingency plan may be identified by MOD, PJHQ, the single-Service Chiefs or the Joint Forces Command, but is initiated by a CDS planning directive. Deputy Chief of Defence Staff (Military Strategy and Operations) (DCDS (Mil Strat & Ops)) orders the formation of a strategic planning group to conduct a political-military estimate, engage with other government departments, and draft CDS’ planning directive (see Annex 1A). Once PJHQ receives the directive, a contingency planning team is formed, in concert with the MOD, supporting commands and other specialist staffs including other government departments. The contingency planning team undertakes a military-strategic estimate, may conduct a reconnaissance, and drafts the joint contingency plan. Depending on the intended operation, the final joint contingency plans may be submitted to the Commander Joint Forces Command and single-Service Chiefs of Staff for approval or, via CDS and the Secretary of State, to the Cabinet. The joint contingency plan is issued and maintained by PJHQ.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Indicators and warnings. Implicit within contingency planning is the need to develop indicators and warnings. These comprise key events or signs which alert planners to an imminent crisis. Indicators and warnings should be selected that provide sufficient notice to activate contingency plans or, if necessary, develop new plans in time to pre-empt, rather than react to, an emerging situation. The Cabinet Office’s six-monthly review of the Countries at Risk of Instability forms the basis of indicators and warnings assessments. Within the MOD, Defence Intelligence is responsible for monitoring indicators and warnings and for linking into other security organisations such as NATO.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operations may be short or continue for years. They may be continuous or intermittent; the military contribution may fluctuate in importance compared with that of the other instruments of power. Irrespective of length, intensity or character, the organisations and processes outlined above provide an adaptive framework for planning and managing operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Doctrine for conducting operations (management rather than design) is covered in JDP 3-00, Campaign Execution and AJP-3, Allied Joint Doctrine for the Conduct of Operations. There are two aspects that are particularly relevant:
• operations review is relevant because it requires commanders and headquarters at all levels (as well as non-military actors) to communicate, interact and understand each other.
• termination and transition is relevant because it involves an aspect of operations, with potentially strategic implications, that requires extensive planning beyond the operational level.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operations review. DCDS (Mil Strat & Ops) is responsible to CDS for monitoring current operations and keeping ongoing operations under strategic review. The DCMO, through operations planning and management processes, provides the information necessary to validate objectives, confirm or modify plans for achieving them, and adjusting capability and resource allocations accordingly. This continual review process, illustrated at Appendix 2C1, takes place at different stages.
a. At the national strategic level, the government’s political strategic analysis, the consequent across-government strategy or plan, and associated national strategic aim and objectives are periodically reviewed through policy, strategy and senior officials’ groups. Regular revisions to political-military estimates feed this review process. Any re-appraisal of the government’s intended role for the military, informed by such review, may result in new direction being issued and a need to review the military-strategic estimate.
b. At the military strategic level, the output of across-government review, ongoing monitoring (by the Chiefs of Staff), and assessments of risk and opportunity (from the Joint Commander at PJHQ and the JFC in theatre) all inform the overall assessment of current and projected progress towards achieving military strategic objectives. This process can be called a strategic review – the form and conduct of which varies from one operation to another. It may result in a review of the extant CDS operations directive, and/or a force level review to confirm or adjust the balance of forces between commitments. Where the situation is judged to have changed significantly, or political intent to have altered, a strategic planning group may be needed to refresh or conduct a further political-military estimate and a revised military strategic estimate.
c. At the operational level, CJO and deployed JFCs will keep ongoing operations under review, using assessment, risk analysis and periodic stock- takes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Termination and transition. Termination and transition operations are complex. They can feature periods of significant strategic and operational-level risk and both have to be factored into planning from the outset. Planning issues include:
• pre-empting the end of hostilities with contingency plans to undertake essential post-conflict activities;
• ensuring forces withdraw in good order;
• making adequate provision for force roulement and any necessary changes in presence, posture and profile;
• switching weights of effort to different types of military activity as the nature of an operation changes over time; and
• planning to ensure enduring security (which may necessitate forces in overwatch) and transition from military to civil primacy requiring civil-military collaboration.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The European Union (EU) planning process is described in Annex 2E. In EU-led operations, the EU’s permanent military elements – the European Union Military Committee and the European Union Military Staff (EUMS) – provide the principal coordination points for the UK MOD. During the early stages of a crisis, the DCMO functions as normal in its national capacity. EU crisis management procedures envisage the EUMS drawing upon planning expertise from either EU member states and/or NATO (under the Berlin Plus agreement) as the crisis unfolds. For the UK, this expertise is provided by the MOD and PJHQ’s links with the European Union Military Committee mirror those with NATO’s Military Committee; the UK military representative attends both. DCMO activity will focus on the UK’s contribution to any proposed EU response, while maintaining oversight of any additional planning support likely to be required by the EUMS.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The EU has three models for operational headquarters, described in Annex 2E. UK planning implications are outlined below.
a. EU-led operations with recourse to NATO assets. If the EU requests NATO support, the relationship between the DCMO and the EU would be comparable to the NATO model. NATO’s Combined Joint Planning Staff (in ACO – J5) would provide planning support at the request of the EU. Deputy SACEUR (a UK 4* appointment) would be the likely choice to fulfil the functions normally performed by SACEUR, as the Military Strategic Commander, for NATO-led operations. The dual-hatted UK military representative is the link with both NATO Headquarters and the EU.
b. EU-led operation without recourse to NATO assets. If NATO assets are not employed, a nation will act as a framework nation using one of the five designated operational headquarters. If PJHQ is selected as the operational headquarters, specific EU multinational headquarters procedures are activated. If another operational headquarters was chosen, some PJHQ staff and extra augmentees would deploy there. Augmentees could include:
• key nucleus staff pre-nominated and trained, drawn mainly from PJHQ/ JFHQ, and immediately available for the EU role;
• primary augmentee multinational staff, pre-nominated and trained, including civilian/military staff from the EUMS and other EU nations;
• primary augmentee parent nation staff nominated and trained staff from other UK headquarters to augment the multinational headquarters; and
• additional augmentee multinational staff, not pre-nominated, to be made available if required.
c. EU operations centre. The EUMS maintain the capability to form an operation headquarters. PJHQ may contribute personnel on request.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
If the UK is the framework nation, the decision on who to appoint as operational commander should consider CJO’s role in other operations, the availability of alternative commanders (possibly drawn from the joint command group) and the staff required to support a UK national contingent. The roles and tasks of CJO and the PJHQ may split along EU and national lines. CJO may act as:
• operational commander and joint commander; or
• operational commander (with CDS selecting another joint commander); or
• joint commander (with CDS selecting another operational commander).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
When the UK provides the JFHQ as the core element of the EU force headquarters, the designated force commander is subordinated to EU operational command. When the force commander is not from the UK, a separate national contingent commander is the link to PJHQ. Where the UK provides the operation headquarters, then it is responsible for providing communications to the force headquarters. Where JFHQ provides the framework of an EU force headquarters, it is responsible for providing communications down to subordinate commands.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK often operates within a US-led coalition. The US command and planning doctrine is detailed in US Joint Publication (JP)-1, Doctrine for the Armed Forces of the United States, and JP-5, Joint Operation Planning. It differs from that of the UK and NATO. The US President is the Commander-in-Chief of all US forces, assisted by the Secretary of Defense. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff advises them but does not enjoy a separate level of command equivalent to the UK MOD. Instead, combatant commanders have a direct link to the US President through the Secretary pf Defense.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within a US-led coalition, the MOD and the DCMO remain the focus for national planning, linked through the British Defence Staff United States and the US Joint Staffs, with PJHQ deploying a small staff to liaise with the combatant commander. A senior British military adviser or national contingent commander is likely to deploy to assist the combatant commander in developing options for any UK involvement.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
UN operations. The UN’s role and organisation is described in Joint Warfare Publication 3-50, The Military Contribution to Peace Support Operations. UN operations may be mounted by a single nation or on a multinational basis as a coalition/alliance. Command and control structures vary depending on the nature and scale of operations, but the UN normally forms a theatre/force headquarters from among the contributing nations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
For operations conducted under a UN mandate, the military force commander acts in support of the civilian Head of Mission, normally a Special Representative of the Secretary General (although in simple operations, the force commander may be appointed Head of Mission). The Head of Mission’s planning staff is responsible for developing coordinating plans that reflect international consensus. These plans must be continually reviewed against mission objectives and the changing situation on the ground.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cooperative operations. UK forces may deploy on a national basis alongside other national contingents, who then agree to de-conflict or cooperate outside the framework of a recognised multinational command structure. The most likely bilateral cooperative operation is the UK-French Combined Joint Expeditionary Force (CJEF) concept. These cooperative operations are most likely to occur during non-combatant evacuation operations, peacekeeping and limited intervention. Although there may be joint objectives, it is likely that each nation also has individual national imperatives, objectives and responsibilities. UK involvement in cooperative operations demands the appointment of a JFC, with a joint task force headquarters to conduct in-theatre liaison between national forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding other departments. A guiding principle of an integrated approach is that institutional familiarity will enhance collaborative working and trust. Just as doctrinal knowledge enhances our conduct of multinational operations, understanding other government departments enhances cooperation and planning. This principle has equal applicability when operating with international organisations and non-governmental organisations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Lead government department. Lead government departments’ responsibilities for planning, response and recovery from emergencies are addressed in the ‘gov.uk’ website. In addition, the Department for International Development (DFID) leads on disasters overseas, and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) leads non-combatant evacuations. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Variance in approach. Each of the principal government departments involved in crisis planning in the context of conflict (FCO, DFID and the MOD), with the interdepartmental Stabilisation Unit facilitating these processes, has a unique way of doing business. Generally, differences may be caused by several factors.
a. Size and structure. The FCO and DFID are smaller than the MOD and have different structures.
b. Culture. The military culture, based on authority and discipline, is often directive. Civilian practice, however, often needs to be consultative, democratic and less hierarchical.
c. Crises orientation. We have traditionally been resourced, prepared and trained as a contingency against future crises which, when they occur, usually attract further funding from the Treasury. Conversely, other government departments tend to view crises as a continuum of ongoing, day-to-day business that they manage within existing funds.
d. Planning approaches. Due to the characteristics of military crisis response, and the planning resources available, we use a formal approach to planning. Some other government departments follow broadly similar lines. However, in certain situations, more fluid models are appropriate, to allow flexibility according to the political nature of the situation. The approach to policy- setting and decision-making may be progressive and iterative.
e. Risk appetite. Military operations involve risk, including that to life. While other departments can, and do, work in hazardous locations, they may withdraw their personnel if they judge the situation to be too dangerous.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding ourselves. Military planners engaged in multi-agency operations should recognise that military practice can appear alien to civilian partners. While other departments recognise the military’s competence, they often have difficulty recognising where and how they can engage effectively. Military processes are sometimes seen by other government departments as cumbersome, labour-intensive and introspective. In particular, civilian planners often cite the sense of ‘unstoppable momentum’ that characterises the military response to a new crisis. This, while a key characteristic of our ‘can do’ spirit, may not be conducive to influence by other government department representatives. Military liaison officers and embedded personnel in other government departments play an important role in enabling successful planning. They can identify the correct interface points and enhance mutual understanding, as well as permanently represent their own commanders’ position. The value of effective liaison is stressed throughout the Allied Command Operations Comprehensive Operations Planning Directive.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Purpose. DFID’s primary focus is poverty reduction, including working towards achieving the UN’s Millennium Goals for poverty reduction, which is reflected in the Department’s objectives and targets. The UK, along with most western countries, is a signatory of the Paris Declaration. This calls on donor nations to work with the governments of states in crisis, as partners, in developing poverty-reducing strategies. DFID will always seek to draw representatives of afflicted states into its planning processes. To deliver sustainable development, DFID must work with other donor nations, international organisations, non-governmental organisations and the agencies of the crisis state, to ensure a coherent international development effort. Consequently, DFID gives priority to working with such partners.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Processes. DFID has developed specific analysis and planning methodologies. Analysis is often conducted by in-country DFID offices which tend to have greater devolved power than other departments’ deployed representatives:
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Country assistance plan. A country assistance plan (CAP) is compulsory for all countries or regions where DFID works (where a threshold of £20M of funding has been reached), and considerable weight is placed upon gaining a detailed understanding of the situation before the plan is written. A number of assessment tools have been developed to help achieve this, some of which – including the ‘country governance assessment’ and ‘fiduciary risk assessment’ – are compulsory. Others, such as the ‘strategic conflict assessment’ and ‘drivers of change’ assessments, will only be done where and when needed. Country assistance plans should provide a long-term strategy and are usually reviewed every three years.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Logical framework analysis. Once developed, country assistance plans could be broken down further into separate sectors, for example education, health or governance and addressed through a collection of programmes and projects. An important tool when developing these projects is ‘logical framework analysis’ or ‘logframe’. This should lay out the hierarchy of objectives within the project, identify key assumptions, state means of objective verification, and highlight any indicators of progress, thereby capturing the logic in the plan.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Purpose. The UK’s foreign policy objectives are articulated as departmental strategic objectives, including four policy goals, in those areas where the FCO leads the UK’s international engagement. The policy goals cover:
• countering terrorism and weapons proliferation;
• preventing and resolving conflict;
• promoting a low carbon, high-growth global economy; and • supporting the development of international institutions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Diplomacy. The FCO is not resourced for significant crisis response. Instead, it considers each situation within the context of an ongoing dynamic of international diplomatic relations. As a result, the FCO tends to focus on immediate issues, in what is frequently a rapidly changing situation.
a. With the exception of the crisis management plans held by diplomatic posts, detailed contingency plans are of limited use to the FCO as they can very quickly become out-of-date and may restrict future flexibility. Furthermore, diplomacy tools tend to involve the fostering and subsequently exploiting personal relationships. Diplomacy, therefore, is a far more individual process than the task-oriented activities carried out by either DFID or the MOD, requiring few formal strategies and plans.
b. It is usual to find the UK’s diplomatic position articulated within ‘lines to take’, Ministerial briefing papers, policy statements and ‘e-grams’ from ambassadors. These are usually the outcome of intense dialogue between regional desks, policy departments, UK missions (to the UN or EU), and embassy staffs, as well as with appropriate other government departments. This results in an agreed view that is then taken forward by FCO staff in Whitehall and the network of embassies, high commissions and other diplomatic posts overseas.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Purpose. The Stabilisation Unit was established in 2004 as a tri-departmental unit of the MOD, FCO and DFID. The Stabilisation Unit’s aim is to deliver integrated conflict prevention and stabilisation expertise for fragile and conflict-affected states, in support of the Government’s objectives. The Stabilisation Unit works in partnership with ‘parent’ government departments and has a deployable capability comprising civil servants and civilian experts.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Objectives. The Stabilisation Unit has seven objectives. They are to:
• coordinate and oversee the delivery of stabilisation activity in priority regions;
• provide expertise on stabilisation and conflict, sharing lessons to inform the Government’s policy and practice;
• provide effective security and justice advice and support (including policing) to fragile and conflict-affected states;
• maximise the contribution of UK policing capabilities in support of the Building Stability Overseas Strategy objectives;
• safely deliver the right people to the right place at the right time and deliver a new UK team of experts dedicated to combating and preventing sexual violence in conflict, in support of the wider FCO initiative;
• increase the support to, and understanding of, stabilisation, including promoting the role of the Stabilisation Unit and the importance of the integrated approach; and
• successfully implement the changes to the Stabilisation Unit resulting from the 2012 review.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Processes. The Stabilisation Unit supports across-government analysis of the drivers of conflict and sources of stability in conflict states, known as the joint analysis of conflict and stability. The Stabilisation Unit also facilitates an integrated approach to strategic planning for conflict and stability. There is inter-departmental guidance that covers joint analysis and the integrated planning process. Analysis and planning for particular contexts are formally commissioned by the National Security Council, the Building Stability Overseas Board or other senior officials.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Joint analysis of conflict and stability. The joint analysis of conflict and stability approach can be used in active conflicts, and in situations that are fragile, but currently peaceful. The process can be light-touch or in-depth, depending on the available timescales and customer needs, and is focussed at the strategic level. The approach is based on three phases.
a. Phase 1. Phase 1 reviews what is already known, establishes objectives, and agrees the timing and the scope of the study. The focus is on drawing in all relevant parts of the Government to agree on key questions and map out existing UK interests and priorities.
b. Phase 2. Phase 2 requires detailed analysis responding to the objectives set out in Phase 1. A governmental team carries out desk and field studies, examining drivers, actors and dynamics in conflict, and sources of resilience and other opportunities for peace. The team provide a set of detailed conclusions and recommendations for further consideration by the Government.
c. Phase 3. Phase 3 focuses on using analyses. It aims to ensure that the findings of analysis inform subsequent UK policy and action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Integrated planning. Ideally the goal in any conflict-affected environment is to achieve an inclusive political settlement that creates the conditions for sustainable peace. Integrated planning (illustrated in Figure 2A.1) helps the Government think through its priorities, level of ambition, how best to engage in a given country and ensures value for money (economy, efficiency and effectiveness). Planners should:
• identify whether there is a UK interest and an intention to engage;
• clarify governance and coordination roles for the UK inter-departmental team early on through written terms of reference;
• ensure that there is a shared understanding across government departments of objectives and key drivers;
• consult closely with people in theatre;
• understand the plans and intentions of local actors;
• identify whether or not assistance is welcomed by the state, and whether or not the operating environment is permissive;
• identify key stakeholders in the international effort, the extent of their authority or influence, and whether one state or multinational body is positioning itself to lead;
• establish the legal boundaries around any intervention;
• decide on options for activity on the basis of consensus, after fully considering the range of options (if there is no consensus, planners should refer to the National Security Council (Officials) or delegated authority);
• secure Ministerial and/or senior level support;
• establish baseline measures and an integrated monitoring and evaluation framework from the outset; and
• implement agreed activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Initiation. Any department may initiate integrated planning – and planning is an iterative process. Following any rapid-onset crisis, the Government’s leadership will be provided at the highest level by the Prime Minister and the National Security Council (NSC). National Security Council (Officials) is the Permanent Secretary-level group that supports the NSC. It will provide the steering group that agrees the aim, objectives and associated owners of the integrated plan, as well as the exit conditions. Below this there will be a core group of working-level officials.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deployment. The types of teams that deploy, and the timing of the deployment, will depend on the assessment of the crisis. Planning can be done on a contingency basis, rather than leading inevitably to action. It may also be the case that, during the planning process, Ministers and officials conclude that there is no reasonable chance of success. Plans will therefore need to be revisited at appropriate intervals. If teams are to deploy, then one of the key early considerations will be whether or not there is a consular crisis and a need to evacuate UK nationals. Another consideration will be the nature, relevance and accuracy of the information that already exists, and whether further scoping is essential to make informed decisions about activity in the local context.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Implementation. Successfully implementing a plan will depend on clear and open lines of communication. Figure 2A.2 is for illustrative purposes and must be adapted to the specific context, depending on the scale of the intervention and whether or not there is a major UK military deployment. Activity will continue until Ministers and officials are satisfied that exit conditions have been met.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Defence Engagement Board. The Defence Engagement Board is chaired jointly by Director General Security Policy and by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) Director General Defence and Intelligence. It provides the strategic context which should govern, and prioritise, using Defence assets to pursue the wide range of thematic strategies which also exist. These strategies include:
• building stability overseas strategy;
• counter terrorism (‘CONTEST’);
• counter proliferation;
• cyber security;
• organised crime;
• overseas territories;
• countries at risk of instability; and
• prosperity, consular and emerging powers.
All international defence engagement and other activities will come together in the FCO-led country business plans in line with the direction of the Strategic Defence and Security Review. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The Strategic Regional Implementation Group for Defence Engagement. Below the Defence Engagement Board is the 1* level Strategic Regional Implementation Group for Defence Engagement (STRIDE). It is jointly chaired by Head Military Strategic Plans of the MOD, and Head Security Policy of the FCO, and brings together relevant stakeholders from across MOD and wider government. The STRIDE is responsible for ensuring implementation of the International Defence Engagement Strategy, in accordance with the strategic direction from the 3* Defence Engagement Board. STRIDE meets four times a year. Response to emerging crisis or a change in strategic circumstances
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Current operations group. A current operations group is chaired by Deputy Chief of the Defence Staff (Military Strategy and Operations) or the Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff (Operations) in his absence and attended by selected staffs from across the MOD. A current operations group may be convened in response to an emerging crisis, or to study a particular aspect of a current operation (such as a change in strategic direction). In the case of the former, it provides situational awareness, orientates the Defence Crisis Management Organisation (DCMO) to the crisis, and considers the utility of (as well as any risks involved in) military intervention, to inform the Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) and hence Ministers.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Strategic planning group. A strategic planning group is usually led by the Assistant Chief of Defence Staff (Military Strategy) (ACDS (Mil Strat)), and includes members from across the MOD as required. Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ) J5 and other government departments are also usually represented. A strategic planning group may be formed prior to a current operations group to initiate a political-military estimate to inform across-government political strategic analysis. Subsequently, once a decision has been taken to initiate more detailed planning, a strategic planning group drafts CDS’ planning directive to the Joint Commander.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Permanent Joint Headquarters contingency planning team. A contingency planning team, led by J5, includes staff from across PJHQ, the Joint Force Headquarters (JFHQ) and, where appropriate, the Joint Force Logistic Component Headquarters (JFLogCHQ), Joint Forces Command, Defence Equipment and Support, and the single-Services. A contingency planning team may form in parallel with the associated MOD strategic planning group. Leadership and membership varies according to the priority, scale and complexity of the planning task (which may involve either contingency or crisis response planning). On receiving CDS’ planning directive, a contingency planning team conducts a military strategic estimate. A contingency planning team may also (re-)form to address longer-term issues as part of current operations planning. The PJHQ contingency planning team process ensures that single-Service commands (including Joint Forces Command for joint enablers) are appropriately engaged in the PJHQ planning and decision-making processes for both contingent and current operations. This also feeds into the DCMO.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Current commitments team. A current commitments team is formed at the onset of a crisis, or when CDS’ planning directive is issued. It forms under an Operations Directorate lead (at 1* or OF-5 level), and includes staff from across the MOD. It liaises with PJHQ, the single-Services, Joint Forces Command, other government departments and, where required, with multinational partners. It functions throughout a crisis, providing a strategic focus for the DCMO. A current commitments team coordinates advice to CDS, PUS and Ministers, and, from policy, provides clear and unambiguous direction and guidance for conducting operations. Accordingly, a current commitments team, with the associated strategic planning group:
• formulates relevant military objectives in relation to the outcomes sought;
• prepares ministerial submissions and responses to parliamentary questions;
• develops CDS operation’s directive to the Joint Commander (see Annex 1B).
Thereafter, a current commitments team focuses on current issues concerning the deployment, activity, sustainment and recovery of forces.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Permanent Joint Headquarters operations team. Once CDS operation’s directive is issued, an operations team – led by PJHQ J389 and drawing upon other expertise as required – develops the Joint Commander’s Mission Directive (see Annex 2C).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operational liaison and reconnaissance team. An operational liaison and reconnaissance team is despatched to a theatre of actual, or potential, operations at the outset of an emerging crisis or as part of contingency planning. It adds significantly to situational awareness and facilitates planning. The JFHQ has the core of two operational liaison and reconnaissance teams on permanent standby, comprising a team leader and core intelligence, operations, logistics and communications staff. JFLogCHQ has a single, more logistics- or humanitarian assistance/disaster relief-focussed team at similar notice. When required, staff from PJHQ, the single-Services, Joint Forces Command, the Stabilisation Unit and other government departments may participate to inform decision-making at the strategic and operational levels. Where this wider representation is not possible, core operational liaison and reconnaissance team members should take checklists provided by those excluded from deploying, to ensure that the requisite information is acquired. Where possible, an operational liaison and reconnaissance team should integrate with in-theatre UK diplomatic structures. Reconnaissance should use military intelligence liaison officers (if deployed), UK military training teams (if applicable), Embassy or High Commission staffs and other in-country sources such as international organisations, non-governmental organisations and international commercial organisations. Increasingly, operational liaison and reconnaissance teams will be integrated teams to support across-government analysis, including personnel from MOD, FCO, DFID and the Stabilisation Unit as required. Operational liaison and reconnaissance team activities may include the following tasks.
a. Liaison. Liaising with host-nation authorities, allies, potential coalition partners and other important agencies and organisations already present in the area of interest.
b. Reconnaissance. Detailed reviews of, for example, appropriate locations for command and control elements, requirements for memoranda of understanding, existing or new status of forces agreements, or the need for access, basing and overflight.
c. Reviewing existing plans. Reviewing existing contingency planning.
d. Advising and reporting. Reporting through PJHQ, the operational liaison and reconnaissance team either returns to the UK to backbrief their findings, or it remains in theatre to facilitate the entry of a joint task force headquarters (or equivalent) and bolster any advance elements.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Strategic planning group/other government departments. Links between the MOD and other government departments are formalised in strategic planning group meetings, current operations groups and through a variety of other across- government engagement, but considerable ad hoc liaison is achieved during routine staff discussions and other contacts.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Strategic planning group/current operations group. The strategic planning group leader is usually a member of the current operations group. Other members of the strategic planning group may also be present at current operations groups, albeit as capability directors or specialists rather than as strategic planning group members.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Strategic planning group/current commitments team. In the early stages of a crisis, a strategic planning group is committed to developing plans and then, as events unfold, refining them with PJHQ J5. During this process, the Group’s Secretariat is responsible for raising submissions to Ministers, through the Director Operational Policy, on matters requiring their decision or attention. A strategic planning group has no active involvement in coordinating current operations, which is the remit of the current commitments team. The presence of a strategic planning group member within such a team ensures that current operations remain harmonised with strategic aims and helps the team to produce CDS’ operation’s directive. As the crisis develops, the strategic planning group member also provides planning insights to the current commitments team.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The EU has the capacity to conduct EU-led operations if the EU Council elects to do so. The Council exercises overall responsibility for planning and conducting EU-led operations, either civilian or military, delegating political control and strategic direction to the Political and Security Committee.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
EU-led operations could involve a range of instruments of power, including diplomatic, economic, humanitarian and civil, as well as military and, therefore, these need to be coordinated. The EU, especially the European Commission, could already be engaged in areas where UK national or coalition military operations are being considered. Alternatively, the EU could become engaged either militarily, or in other ways, in crises where the UK has a strategic interest.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Permanent military structures are provided by the European Union Military Committee (EUMC), and the European Union Military Staff (EUMS) who are located in Brussels.
a. EU Military Committee. The EUMC is responsible for providing the Political and Security Committee with military advice, and recommendations, on all military matters, and for directing all military activities within the EU’s remit. The Chairman of the EUMC acts as the primary point of contact for the operation commander during EU-led military operations.
b. EU Military Staff. The EUMS provide early warning, situation assessment, and conduct planning at the political and strategic level for Petersberg tasks, including identifying appropriate European national and multinational forces. This could include developing military strategic options, preparing an EUMC Initiating Military Directive to the Operation Commander, and coordinating military planning with the EU’s Commission and Parliament.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In the event of a crisis, the EU assesses options, usually in consultation with nations and other international organisations, especially NATO. Military aspects of the crisis should be examined by the EUMC, drawing on the expertise of the EUMS. At an appropriate juncture, following the development of a crisis management concept, the Council should approve a general political assessment and a cohesive set of options. Thereafter, the EUMC should issue a Military Strategic Option Directive to the Director General of the EUMS, formally inviting him to draw up one or a series of military strategic options.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Once the Council has decided to take action, and a military strategic option has been selected, an operation commander should be appointed, a chain of command designated, and an operation headquarters selected. There are three options available.
a. EU-led operations with recourse to NATO planning assets. NATO’s
ACO-J5 planning staff generate initial planning support for the EU, and provide planning staff and facilities thereafter. Deputy Supreme Allied Commander Europe would be the likely choice as operation commander.
b. EU-led operation without recourse to NATO planning assets. If NATO planning assets were not to be employed, one nation could elect to act as the framework nation, using one of five potential EU operation headquarters (located in the UK (Permanent Joint Headquarters (PJHQ)), France, Germany, Italy and Greece).
c. EU Operations Centre. The EUMS maintains the capability to form an operation headquarters in Brussels, drawing on nations as required. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Selecting a force commander and force headquarter could occur simultaneously or, if alternatives are available, wait for the operation commander to be appointed. The most likely command and control template, based on a framework nation model, would have both the operation and force headquarters formed by the same nation, although other command and control combinations are possible. Where a framework nation model is used, other EU nations, as well as EUMS personnel, could be expected to provide personnel to fill posts in both headquarters.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Following a Council decision to take action, the EUMC should issue an Initiating Military Directive to the operation commander, which directs him to begin operational-level planning. The EU planning methodology is very similar to that of NATO, and the outputs include a concept of operations (CONOPS) and operation plans (OPLANs), and ultimately generate, direction, deployment, sustainment and recovery of a joint force. The EU process is, however, initially more ‘linear’ than NATO’s, which can conduct operations planning in parallel at various levels. This is principally due to the decision not to establish a permanent EU command structure that would duplicate NATO. Hence subordinate levels of command have to be established for a particular operation before planning in parallel can commence. Efforts to streamline the process, for example, by designating an operation commander and operation headquarters early, are used as much as possible.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Although exact command and control arrangements for any EU-led military operation should be mission-dependent, they normally encompass three levels of command, as shown in Figure 1.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Comprehensive approach. EU planning for EU-led operations takes into account the EU comprehensive approach to crisis management. Such planning cannot be conducted in isolation. The tools available to the EU in times of crisis are wide ranging across its institutions and policy areas and comprise political and humanitarian, as well as military, actions. This comprehensive approach leads to an important principle in EU military headquarters at all levels, which is the development of links, dependent on the mission, to ensure coordination with: governments and authorities in the crisis area; authorities of force contributing nations; EU representatives and bodies (for example, the EU Police Mission); international organisations and non-governmental organisations; supporting headquarters; and national intelligence organisations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Command embraces authority, responsibility and accountability. It has a legal and constitutional status – codified in Queen’s Regulations. It is also vested in a commander by their superior. Authority enables an individual to influence events and order subordinates to implement decisions. While commanders can devolve specific authority, they retain overall responsibility for their command – responsibility is thus fundamental to command. Accountability involves a liability and obligation to answer for properly using delegated responsibility, authority and resources; it includes the duty to act. Thus, a commander who delegates responsibility should grant sufficient authority to subordinates to enable them to carry out their task. Subordinates remain accountable to their superior for executing assigned tasks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Exercising command includes the process by which a commander makes decisions, conveys their intent and impresses their will upon subordinates. It comprises three inter-related aspects.
a. Decision-making. Timely, accurate and effective decision-making (including assessing risk) enables adaptive command, optimises tempo and leads to success on operations. The art of command depends on recognising when to decide and when to act. Both rely on good judgement and intuition, based on situational understanding. However, commanders may need to identify fleeting opportunities and exploit them on the basis of incomplete information. Decisions should be communicated effectively and, where possible, personally. This inspires confidence and promotes cohesion between commanders and their subordinates. The ability to make difficult decisions and remain resolute, particularly when the outcome is uncertain, underpins strong leadership.
b. Leadership. Commanders have sole responsibility for ensuring that their plan delivers the best chances of success. The way in which they exercise leadership is determined by their character, style and experience, as well as the mix of personalities within their force or organisation. The intangible nature of the relationship between commanders and their subordinates may affect the way in which forces are employed and the enterprises they undertake. Different situations demand different styles of leadership, requiring varying amounts
of regulation, delegation, inspiration and coercion. Leadership is examined in more detail in Joint Doctrine Publication (JDP) 0-01, UK Defence Doctrine.
c. Control. Control is coordinating activity, through processes and structures, to enable a commander to manage risk and achieve success. The extent of military control over a situation will be influenced by a range of external and internal factors. Control may be delegated to specialist staff, systems or processes. But commanders may need to retain personal control to ensure that their intent is achieved. Through appropriate decentralisation and delegation, commanders should seek to increase their subordinates’ freedom to act.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A commander’s immediate subordinates may themselves be senior, experienced commanders, including those from other nations. Subordinates should have confidence in their commander’s professional ability, judgement and firmness of purpose. Commanders should explain the rationale underlying their chosen course of action so that their subordinates understand the reasoning behind their decision and have a clear sense of purpose. Where this does not happen, subordinates should have confidence that their commander’s decisions are properly considered and valid. Furthermore, commanders should always be prepared to make use of the ideas and objections of others. Good ideas are not the sole preserve of senior ranks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders may have to exercise their command when there is uncertainty, risk, violence, fear and danger. Their success depends largely on experience, flexibility and determination. Ultimately, it is the commander’s ability to shape those aspects amenable to control and retain sufficient capacity for the unexpected that must prevail.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Principles of joint and multinational command. The principles of joint and multinational command are:
• unity of command;
• continuity of command;
• clear chain of command;
• integration of command;
• the manoeuvrist approach; and
• mission command.
These are detailed in AJP-01, Allied Joint Doctrine, Chapter 6 but mission command, as described in NATO doctrine, has a slightly different nuance to that adopted by our forces. The two are fully complementary but, while Allied doctrine focuses mission command at the joint operational level, we encourage using it down to the lowest levels. Our national commanders should not automatically expect allies to apply mission command as described below. This is important when the UK is acting in a commanding role, and equally when acting as a subordinate. UK commanders operating in an alliance context should understand mission command. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK’s philosophy of mission command has four enduring tenets:
• timely decision-making;
• thorough understanding of a superior commander’s intent;
• clear responsibility on the part of subordinates to fulfil intent; and
• determination to take the plan through to a successful conclusion.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The fundamental guiding principle is the absolute responsibility to act, or to decide not to act, within the framework of a superior commander’s intent. This approach requires a style of command that promotes decentralised command, freedom and speed of action and initiative, but which is responsive to superior direction when subordinates overreach themselves.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In practical terms, mission command has five essential elements:
• commanders must ensure that their subordinates understand their intent, their own contributions and the context within which they are to act;
• commanders should exercise a minimum of control over their subordinates, consistent with their experience and ability, while retaining responsibility for their actions;
• subordinates are told what effect they are to realise and why;
• subordinates are allocated sufficient resources to carry out their missions; and
• subordinates decide for themselves how best to achieve their superior’s intent.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mission command assists subordinates to understand their commander’s intent and their place within the plan. This enables them to execute activity with the maximum freedom of action.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mission command requires delegating authority and agile execution. A commander should be pragmatic when applying mission command as not all subordinates are equally capable. A commander should be flexible in the extent to which they delegate their authority; this will depend upon the situation, the nature of their command, the degree of multinational and multi-agency interaction, and the predominant activities being undertaken. Delegation will also depend on commanders’ and subordinates’ abilities, training, personalities and experience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Uncertainty or ambiguity within a particular operational context may drive a commander to exercise more, rather than less, control. A commander may need to intervene to exploit opportunities and mitigate risks that may not be fully appreciated by subordinates, but they should be wary of unnecessary intervention. This tends to create risk-aversion and a dependency culture amongst subordinates.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Effective command, including the processes and systems that underpin it, is a vital component of delivering military operations. The operational-level commander (Joint Force Commander (JFC)) is responsible for both the plan and its subsequent execution. Their personal effectiveness is determined by a combination of ability, intellect and intuition. However, it is often their instinct and vision that confer distinct advantage. Moltke referred to this decisive aspect as ‘talent’:

<|startoftext|>
Intellect and practical ability embody the particular skill that a JFC brings to an operation. This skill is applied through a variety of established principles, practices and procedures, themselves honed through training, education and experience. While attention tends to focus on the additional benefit of a commander’s instinct, this is most effective if it is based upon skilled and drilled professionalism.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding equips leaders with the insight and foresight needed to make effective decisions, as well as manage the associated risks and second-order and subsequent effects. JDP 04, Understanding develops the commander’s approach to understanding, whether as an individual, as part of a team, or in a coalition.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Moral and physical courage are important qualities in a commander, at whatever level, although at the operational-level moral courage is particularly important. Command styles are heavily dependent on personality, but in deciding on an approach to command, JFCs may consider the following issues.
a. At what level are decisions to be made? Avoid the danger of commanding too little and interfering too much. Consider the command responsibilities and authority in relation to the type of opponent (conventional, irregular and so on).
b. How to maintain morale? Consider combining four characteristics – effective leadership, strong discipline (self and group), a feeling of comradeship and self-respect.
c. How to build relations? Consider the importance of generating trust, shared confidence and knowledge from similar experiences, noting the value of credibility.
d. How to bond the headquarters? Mission command is as applicable to subordinate staffs as it is to subordinate commanders to deliver effective control and coordination.
e. How to disseminate their intent widely? JFCs should personally issue their mission and concept of operations, and be closely involved in articulating how they are going to command the operation. These elements, but especially commander’s intent where JFCs express the overall effect they wish to achieve against the adversary, are critical in enabling subordinates to act purposefully when faced with unforeseen opportunities, or in the absence of orders.
f. How to extend their personal influence? The need to influence both domestic and international decision-makers is an important factor. In multinational operations, identifying the point where the greatest national influence can be achieved, underpinned by the contribution of credible and robust military forces, is vital.
g. Where to locate their command? Where, and how best, to command
a force is a challenge. JFCs must make time to go forward, make their
own estimate of the situation, and see their commanders and troops. Communications allow JFCs more flexible options for command and control and headquarters location. This should be tempered by the risks of:
• increasing their vulnerability;
• potentially removing them from locations of political influence (especially when they have chosen to collocate their own headquarters at the diplomatic focal point); and
• becoming unnecessarily and adversely entangled in tactical activity.
h. How to remain agile? The UK’s approach to command emphasises
agility as a way of dealing with complexity and optimising effectiveness. By remaining agile, JFCs are able to seize and retain the initiative, and maintain decision advantage over their opponent(s), to exploit opportunities and reinforce success. To fully exploit all resources, JFCs should identify any change in the weight of effort required in relation to different activities. This ensures that opportunities created by success are not wasted and that we minimise redundant activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In an integrated approach, the need to coordinate and synchronise or, at the very least de-conflict, the capabilities and activities of other agencies, creates a more complex environment for operational-level decisions. A commander’s ability to make decisions is strengthened by:
• an empathy for different organisational cultures, engendered by institutional familiarity, trust and transparency, and through frequent personal contact and information sharing;
• information superiority which ensures that the potentially overwhelming volume of information available to a commander does not obstruct or overload their capacity for decision-making; 
• personal communications of decisions to subordinates; and
• confidence particularly when information is ambiguous or incomplete.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
All military operations must be conducted within a legal framework. The laws that apply will vary depending upon the nature of the operation. The applicable law may be a combination of international and domestic (national) laws and will include human rights law. Failing to comply with the law, or even perceived failure, can significantly undermine campaign authority. JFCs should ensure that:
• they, and those under their command, understand their legal responsibilities and obligations and are trained on the relevant rules of engagement;
• all commanders ensure they are compliant with the law, and observe rules of engagement, by exercising command authority over their subordinates;
• in a multinational context, they consider the differing national policy positions and legal obligations of respective national contingents;
• any suspected unlawful activity is reported immediately and thoroughly investigated; and
• commanders have access to specialist legal advice.
Political considerations
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
JFCs may find that political realities, both national and multinational, preclude defining clear strategic objectives, either for the operation as a whole or for individual troop contributing nations. In these circumstances they may have to derive their own end-state from the limited direction they have received.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Due to the challenges faced by national and multinational strategic decision-making bodies, JFCs may spend a disproportionate amount of time managing their strategic links at the expense of time spent in their own headquarters or dealing with subordinate commanders. This may be further compounded by the demands of hosting visiting political and military dignitaries to cultivate and maintain positive strategic relations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The requirement to coalition-build (advising, encouraging and informing multinational partners) and the need to manage crises by consensus in multinational and multi-agency operations, slows down decision-making. It also introduces uncertainty, and places even greater time pressure on JFCs. However, handling these issues, including frequent visits by senior partners, is not just desirable, but a core feature of command.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At the operational and tactical levels, each government department will monitor and conduct activity, including allocating manpower and resources, within its own area of responsibility. Consequently, JFCs may play a vital role in helping to coordinate a range of competing priorities and to sequence activities. Their headquarters may have to act as the focal point for an integrated approach in a non- permissive environment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The overriding consideration is to focus effort on achieving any national strategic aim and objectives. Reaching a shared understanding of the situation and potential responses to it, facilitates the coordinated application of the instruments of national power, and retains the cultural and professional diversity required to address complex problems.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A UK commander may find himself acting as a:
• JFC on a multinational operation where the UK is the lead or framework nation;
• UK national contingent commander where the UK is contributing forces to an operation led by another nation;
• UK component commander within a multinational component command headquarters; or
• commander in an alliance/coalition appointment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operating multinationally, either as part of a formal alliance or an ad hoc coalition, introduces many challenges for both the multinational JFC and contributing nations’ national contingent commanders. Regardless of the UK commander’s role, they should be cognisant of both perspectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A multinational force commander requires political acumen, patience and tact. Their key challenges will include achieving unity of effort (although they may aspire to unity of command) and fostering organisational agility.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A force commander should understand each national contingent’s particular strengths, weaknesses and political objectives, as well as its national ethos, history and culture. They should balance capabilities and distribute the workload and risk equitably, so that no one nation sustains disproportionate casualties or receives undue credit, either of which may weaken the cohesion of a multinational force.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Common doctrine and agreed structures underpin unity of effort within an established alliance. Ad hoc coalitions may have sub-optimal command structures and can be hampered by the range of national political aims. Cultural or procedural differences between national contingents may also create friction and reduce tempo. A force commander may be required to accept no more than unity of purpose in such circumstances.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Initially, consensus and cooperation may be based on little more than an agreement on the art of the possible. This should be developed progressively through mutual trust, understanding, patience and respect for national perspectives and positions, and promoted through personal and professional relationships between a multinational force commander and national contingent commanders. To improve their perspective on any national agendas and foster improved relations across the coalition, a force commander should invest time in engaging personally with any national political representatives who visit their area of operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A force commander should appreciate the linguistic and cultural challenges of multinational operations, recognising that it is their responsibility to communicate with all subordinates including those for whom English is not the first language. Clarity and brevity are important, as is using simple English and defined terms, noting that even these may not translate directly into another language.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Force generation will be carried out at the military-strategic level, with limited consultation with the force commander. So, what JFCs think they need to achieve the mission, may not be matched by the respective national force contributions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The presence of international and contributing nations’ media, and the need to align national positions, is a further factor to be addressed by the force commander. A proactive and coordinated approach is essential. Supportive media coverage plays a major role in maintaining the endorsement of both the international community and domestic audiences. These are fundamental factors in maintaining coalition morale and cohesion.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The impact of multinationality on organisational agility is often significant. The most fundamental impact is one of time and tempo; activities take longer to plan and execute, and maintaining high and common tempo is challenging. Decisive engagement with an opponent (who may be more agile) is more difficult to achieve than in national operations. While a range of factors may contribute towards a lack of organisational agility in multinational operations, the two most prevalent are interoperability and information management.
a. Interoperability. Nations will contribute a broad range of equipments, technologies, languages, doctrine and training to coalition operations. While some alliances, most notably NATO, attempt to mitigate interoperability issues through standardisation, problems will remain. Any lack of interoperability, which impacts on the principles of war or operations, will significantly limit the JFC’s plans. JFCs will need to understand the interoperability challenges and ensure their operations design accommodates them.
b. Information management. Despite technological advances, the challenges of gaining and interpreting information remain. In multinational operations, problems are exacerbated by the limitations and constraints on information management. Many nations’ communications and information systems (CIS) are incompatible. The constraints on handling and sharing information and intelligence also compound the difficulties faced by JFCs. NATO’s information management requirements are addressed in the Allied Command Operations Comprehensive Operations Planning Directive and AJP-6.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Each national contingent commander is a key decision-maker in their own right, though none share the JFC’s authority. A national contingent commander should consider the following.
a. Influence.
• Shaping coalition plans based on personal relationships.
• Advising JFCs on national capabilities and limitations (such as interoperability and rules of engagement).
• Identifying and managing levels of risk for national forces.
b. Direct.
• Exercising operational control of national forces, and directing/ approving their use in line with national direction.
• In close liaison with the NATO Joint Logistic Support Group Headquarters, de-conflicting, prioritising and, where appropriate, directing the reception, staging, onward movement and integration of national forces.
• Assuring logistic, medical and communications and information systems support.
• Determining and coordinating national force protection policy and posture.
• Coordinating and shaping national media.
c. Support.
• Acting as a figurehead – building and sustaining national contingent cohesion.
• Providing legal advice.
• Facilitating strategic intelligence integration, and command and control architecture.
d. Inform.
• Determining any need for military strategic support.
• Reporting tactical and operational developments (including risks to strategic objectives).
• Developing memoranda of understanding and status of forces agreements with host nation(s) as required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
JFCs must understand the national political sensitivities of each of their contingents; any anticipated points of difference should be resolved early. If a national contingent commander believes that an order is contrary to national interests, they retain the ability to veto it. Political sensitivity over coalition operations and risk- aversion in contributing nations’ governments both mean that the potential for national veto remains a key factor in coalition operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National limitations on the JFC’s freedom of action can arise due to many factors.
a. Nations and their national contingent commanders may see their mission in different terms. Some may perceive long-term reconstruction as the priority and others may prioritise counter-insurgency and its urgent security requirements. Time spent conceptualising is seldom wasted; it will help to reduce coalition friction and shocks.
b. The command authority passed to the force commander is sometimes complicated by differing national interpretations of command authority.
c. The rules of engagement given to JFCs regarding using force may not be the same as those imposed by nations on their contingents. Furthermore, different contingents may interpret the Laws of Armed Conflict differently.
d. Individual nations may have different outlooks on force protection reflecting varying attitudes to risk. In some cases, JFCs may be constrained by having to provide additional force protection for a national contingent.
e. The targeting process, which may require agreement from all coalition members to each and every target, is likely to be written into the coalition mandate.
f. Nations place constraints on how to employ their forces, including restricting using national contingents to specified areas or types of activity.
Some of these constraints may only come to the attention of a commander during the course of planning an operation, when issuing orders, or in reaction to events (such as casualties, an unwelcome task, or changes in public opinion).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The media has become so important in maintaining public and political support that a commander cannot disconnect himself from it, nor should they allow it to be the sole focus of their efforts. Military operations, and particularly the senior commanders involved, invariably attract media scrutiny.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
JFCs should anticipate such attention, which may be highly intrusive, and prepare themselves and their headquarters accordingly. They should be honest about their ability to deal with the media and carefully balance using a media spokesperson with their own appearances. There are likely to be moments where the message is so important that they must deliver it personally. Occasionally, the issue may be of such a critical nature that they may have to compromise operations security. In every instance JFCs must ask themselves – who am I engaging, and for what reason? They should not be overly passive in their dealings with the media, but should engage actively using as many channels as possible to persuade, rebut and advocate the message(s).

There are no universally accepted definitions for cyber but, for the purpose of this primer, the definitions from UK cyber doctrine will be used. The definitions for cyberspace and cyber are below. Cyber To operate and project power in and from cyberspace to influence the behaviour of people or the course of events. Cyberspace An operating environment consisting of the interdependent network of digital technology infrastructures (including platforms, the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer systems, as well as embedded processors and controllers), and the data therein spanning the physical, virtual and cognitive domains.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In November 2015 the UK’s National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 identified three core strategic objectives. These are to:
• protect our people – at home, in our Overseas Territories and abroad, and to protect our territory, economic security, infrastructure and way of life;
• project our global influence – reducing the likelihood of threats materialising and affecting the UK, our interests, and those of our allies and partners; and
• promote our prosperity – seizing opportunities, working innovatively and supporting UK industry.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK’s cyber capability supports these three strategic objectives through three core functions. These are:
• preventing conflict and threats materialising;
• protecting the UK and its Overseas Territories from attack, particularly (but not exclusively) in, and through, cyberspace; and
• projecting influence and power rapidly and responsively, either directly from the UK or as part of an expeditionary operation.
Defence supports these three strategic objectives by ensuring that our UK Armed Forces:
• have strong cyber defences;
• are able to project power in cyberspace (just as they do in the other operating environments);
• are ready to assist the wider UK in the event of a significant cyber incident; and
• can respond to a cyber attack as they would respond to any other attack – using whichever capability is most appropriate.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence’s ability to conduct protective operations in cyberspace is mission critical, demands resilience and enables information superiority. Our adversaries will contest our freedom of manoeuvre in cyberspace, so we need to have agile capabilities that can anticipate, deter, prevent, detect, assess, protect, respond to and recover from attacks against our networks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber can also act as an information source in its own right. Information gained from cyber can be used to strengthen our own cyber defences, but can also form the basis of intelligence analysis.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence’s activities in cyberspace are constantly being transformed. To defend itself, Defence needs to ensure existing security policies are enforced and, where risk is held, the full impact of that risk is completely understood. The basics of network defence go a long way in protecting Defence’s data, but there will always be vulnerabilities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber is recognised as a capability that must be integrated with all areas of military planning, preparation activities and budgeting across the new Defence Operating Model. A range of support and implementation is required, covering:
• research and development;
• training;
• procurement and through-life cost management of capabilities;
• fielding deployment of those capabilities; and
• eventual disposal.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyberspace is a complex and dynamic environment, interdependent with the electromagnetic spectrum, and is key to all military operations on land, sea, and in air and space. It is far more than just the Internet. Cyberspace is a pervasive and all-encompassing operating environment, incorporating, for example, aircraft flight control systems, medical life-support systems, physical device controllers and national electricity distribution systems. Cyberspace can also be less geographically constrained than other environments. So, distance and reach must be viewed differently to traditional environments when considering cyberspace operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Access to cyberspace is possible via many means, most often through computer terminals, laptops, tablets and mobile phones. Connectivity may be achieved via wireless connections or physical cables. Cyberspace is dependent upon physical assets – power sources, cables, networks, data-centres, as well as the people who operate and manage them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The technologies and systems that define and make up cyberspace have evolved from being enablers of modern life into being fundamental and critical to how we live. All aspects of modern society are influenced by information flows, making cyberspace an integral part of today’s global environment. We now live in a digital world and have become familiar with smartphones, office and home computers, social media applications and email.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Most electronic control systems have cyber vulnerabilities, although not all are readily exploitable. We would consider a short-term loss of the Internet or connectivity in our homes as an irritant; but someone hacking into our email account and stealing our personal information is more serious. A cyber attack leading to a prolonged loss of the electricity grid or Defence cyber and cyberspace-dependent capabilities, on the other hand, could have severe consequences, including loss of life and could equate to a kinetic attack.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Layers of cyberspace. Cyberspace can be thought of as comprising of six interdependent layers: social; people; persona; information; network; persona; and real, as shown in Figure 1.
<|endoftext|>
 
<|startoftext|>
Social, people and persona layers. The social, people and persona layers consist of the details that connect people to cyberspace and the people and groups who interact with and operate the networks. Unique addresses or titles are matched to virtual addresses which, in turn, map to the real and network layers. A single person may have multiple personas; for example, a person may have different social media accounts accessed through different computers and mobile devices. Equally, multiple people can share a single persona; for example, a multi-user single email account. Attributing responsibility and targeting in cyberspace is difficult; personas can be complex, with elements in many virtual locations and not linked to a single physical location or form. Significant intelligence collection and analysis capabilities are required to gain sufficient insight and situational awareness to enable effective targeting and to create the desired effect. The social, people and persona layers can be further analysed through four sub-areas: social networking; operating and maintenance procedures; people; and security.
a. Social networking. Social networking covers information regarding human interactions and may include details on culture, interests, how and with whom people communicate, and their persona or personas.
b. Operating and maintenance procedures. Operating procedures across the breadth of cyber operations include network monitoring, information assurance, disaster recovery, contingency and backup plans. Maintenance includes the skill levels of the personnel maintaining the network and the frequency of maintenance activity.
c. People. This refers to all individuals involved; including those developing and operating the various systems.
d. Security. Security includes the security posture of the network and levels of awareness of the network users, managers and maintainers.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Information Layer. The information layer consists of the connections that exist between network nodes. A node is a physical device connected to a network, such as a computer, smartphone or other mobile device. It also includes:
• individual network configuration;
• data, applications and protocols which govern interaction across the physical layer;
• information assurance processes;
• details of communication service providers; transfer protocols;
• Internet domain names; and
• ownership data.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
primary method of security (for example, information assurance) and integrity. This layer can often (but not exclusively) be the target for: signals intelligence; cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and measurement and signature intelligence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Real layer. The real layer consists of a geographic aspect and a physical aspect. The geographic aspect relates to the location of elements of a network, such as under the sea or ground, or in a building. The physical aspect concerns what components are present – such as hardware, systems software and infrastructure.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As a relatively new operating environment, Defence continues to develop the means by which to exploit cyberspace and the cyber operating environment to its best advantage. Cyberspace is even contested in peacetime – threat actors are constantly probing our networks seeking vulnerabilities, intelligence or military and commercial advantage.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The concept of near, mid and far operating spaces help explain the cyber environment and how it might affect operations.
a. Near. The near comprises networks and systems that are controlled and assured by the commander, or controlled and assured on their behalf by Defence.
b. Mid. The mid comprises networks and systems that are critical to the operation or campaign, but are not controlled and assured by the commander. They may be controlled and assured on their behalf by a third party – for example, a commercial company or other government department.
c. Far. The far comprises networks and systems that, if influenced, will prove critical to the operation or campaign. Such systems will be predominately outside friendly forces control or assurance and are likely to be owned by third parties. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are a number of themes which emerge when we consider the cyber environment. Some of these include the following.
a. The cyber operating environment is largely global, but vulnerable.
b. Civilian and military information infrastructures, whether national, coalition or international, co-exist and overlap, posing problems for managing security within a network-enabled Defence capability.
c. A high baseline for cyber security is required which has implications for education and training, timeliness of system maintenance and intelligence (cyber situational awareness).
d. The threat in, and through, cyberspace is largely, but not exclusively, against the exploitation, manipulation and theft of information held across the Defence enterprise (this includes close collaborative defence of its civilian procurement, logistics and other support contractors).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Mainstreaming. All Defence personnel are expected to operate effectively and securely in cyberspace, using and exploiting information and information systems and working to counter potential threats. Cyber’s pervasive and ubiquitous nature means Defence must consider the full range of cyber capabilities and requirements across the Defence Lines of Development. This requires awareness, education, individual and collective training, exercises and an understanding of risk management in cyberspace.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Competencies. Cyber operations require well-educated and trained professionals with relevant capability and capacity, as well as specialist technical and tactical expertise for success. Additionally, personnel who understand human factors will have an important role. The Ministry of Defence’s (MOD’s) Cyber Skills Functional Competence Framework addresses these needs through the operational and planning/policy competencies relevant to military cyber operations. Competency is the combination of knowledge, skills and experience. The competency levels are: awareness; practitioner; senior practitioner; and expert.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding. Defence cyber Operations staff need a sound understanding of the commander’s intent and must be able to rapidly assess the impact of their decisions or recommendations. They should, however, be aware that:
• decisions may often need to be made without the opportunity for referral upwards for guidance; and 
• independent decisions may need to be made when it is necessary to maintain operational tempo and, where appropriate, authority for action has been delegated by the commander.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Skills. More generally, skills relevant to the cyber environment are articulated in the Institute of Information Security Functional Skills Framework and the MOD Information Assurance Portal provides additional reference material on information assurance and cyber related subjects.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are a number of bodies of law which may be applicable to
cyber activity. The applicable laws will depend on whether the activity is supporting military operations during peacetime (including training and testing) or an armed conflict. There are no international treaties specifically addressing cyber activity, but existing international law is applicable. UK cyber activities must follow international and domestic law. Legal support to military operations must include an operational understanding of the cyber activities, including intended effects and possible unintended consequences. More details on international law applicable to cyber activity can be found at Annex 1A.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Collaboration with international partners is important to develop Defence’s cyber capabilities. International engagement is managed by MOD’s Cyber and Space Policy, which has close links with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s International Cyber Policy Unit.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
While broader Defence bilateral partnership objectives are a key factor, cyber engagement is principally driven by existing and anticipated military requirements, hence there is a strong allied relationship. The UK is a leading nation in North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) on cyber, working to ensure that it secures its own networks and encouraging all partners to develop their own cyber capabilities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber brings additional complexities to the structures and processes of NATO, our allies and the European Union through the need to include national organisations, such as computer emergency response teams (CERTs), and national and international legal requirements. Key organisations are listed below.
a. NATO Communications and Information Agency. The NATO Communications and Information (NCI) Agency manages those networks owned by NATO. The NCI Agency also has a coordinating role across individual NATO and NATO-nation CERTs.
b. NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence. Although not under unified NATO command, the Centre of Excellence’s mission is to enhance capability, cooperation and information sharing among NATO, its member nations and partners in cyber defence by virtue of education, research and development, lessons-learned and consultation. The Centre is funded by 18 nations, including the UK, who, with NATO, can task the Centre of Excellence.
c. European Network Information Security Agency. This agency is the European Union focus for technical assistance with the security aspects of cyberspace.
Individual NATO nations have their own cyber command structures. In many cases, Defence has direct liaison with these. An example of this is the UK-France relationship where a formal bilateral arrangement exists.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Unlawful intervention. The customary international law principle of non-intervention prohibits states from intervening or interfering in the affairs of another state. The principle prohibits conduct that is coercive in character against affairs that a state should be permitted to decide freely, including the choice of political, economic, social and cultural systems and the formulation of foreign policy. A cyber operation which does not constitute a use of force or armed attack may nevertheless contravene the principle of non-intervention.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Countermeasures. An internationally wrongful act committed by a state entitles the injured state to take proportionate countermeasures. Countermeasures are actions:
• in light of a refusal to remedy the wrongful act;
• directed against the other state to induce compliance with its obligations; and
• which are proportionate.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Principle of state responsibility. The principle of state responsibility applies equally to cyber operations. If one state assists another state, the assisting state must consider the lawfulness of the other state’s activity; if the assisting state would consider the act to be internationally unlawful, that state could be responsible in international law for that act.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Prohibition on the threat or use of force. Article 2(4) of the United Nations Charter (which reflects customary international law) prohibits the threat or use of force. A cyber operation may constitute a use of force if it causes the same or similar effects as a kinetic attack.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Armed attack. Armed attack is not defined in international law, but it is generally accepted that it must be an act of armed force of sufficient gravity, having regard to its scale and effects. A cyber operation may constitute an armed attack if its method, gravity and intensity of force is such that its effects are equivalent to those achieved by a kinetic attack which would reach the level of an armed attack.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Self-defence. The inherent right of individual and collective self-defence is customary international law and is also recognised by Article 51 of the United Nations Charter. An armed attack or imminent armed attack triggers the right of self-defence or anticipatory self-defence. Any response under self-defence must be necessary and proportionate; it must be necessary to use force to deal with the threat. Military action should only be used as a last resort and the force used must be proportionate to the threat and limited to what is necessary to deal with the threat. There may be practical challenges in the application of self-defence to cyber, for example:
• in attributing a cyber attack;
• the speed with which an attack can be conducted, which greatly reduces the ability to respond to an imminent attack;
• the use of spoofing and deception by an actor that implicates another; and
• the difficulty of determining the original intent of the perpetrator, even if actions are provable and actors identifiable.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Law of Armed Conflict. Cyber operations conducted during an armed conflict to which the UK is a party, and which are related to that conflict, are governed by the existing rules of the Law of Armed Conflict (LOAC) including the prohibition on perfidy (inviting the confidence of an adversary as to protection under the LOAC) and principles of neutrality. Cyber operations that constitute a use of force during an armed conflict are subject to compliance with the following principles.
a. Military necessity. A state can only use that degree and kind of force, not otherwise prohibited by the LOAC, that is required to achieve the complete or partial submission of the enemy at the earliest possible moment with the minimum expenditure of life and resources.
b. Distinction. Attacks must only be directed against military objectives; civilians and civilian objects must not be attacked. Military objectives are those objects that by their nature, location, purpose or use make an effective contribution to military action and whose total or partial destruction, capture or neutralisation, in the circumstances ruling at the time, offers a definite military advantage. 
c. Proportionality. An action is proportionate when it does not cause incidental civilian harm which is excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.
d. Humanity. The infliction of superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering is prohibited.
<|endoftext|>

Methods of war and protections. The laws governing means and methods of war and protections apply equally to cyber activity, as they would traditional methods of warfare. Two examples are listed below but they are not intended to be definitive of the applicable rules.
a. Acts or threats of violence with a primary purpose to spread terror among the civilian population are prohibited.
b. Attacks against installations containing dangerous forces, namely dams, dykes and nuclear electrical generating stations are prohibited if attacks may cause the release of dangerous forces and consequent severe losses among the civilian population. Other military objectives located at, or in the vicinity of, these works or installations shall not be made the object of attack if such an attack may cause the release of dangerous forces.

The growing role of cyberspace in society has opened up new threats, as well as new opportunities. For this reason the UK’s National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 identifies cyber attacks on the UK as a ‘Tier 1’ threat – one of the UK’s highest priorities for action. Defence has no choice but to find ways to confront and overcome these threats if the UK is to flourish in an increasingly competitive and globalised world. An overview of the cyber threats to the UK can be found in The UK Cyber Security Strategy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The risk to national security and economic well-being includes the threat to public and private sector information communication technology (ICT). The digital architecture on which we now rely was built to be efficient and interoperable – security was given less consideration. Information theft or system disruption could have serious consequences on government, military, industrial and economic well-being. Cyberspace is permanently contested by our adversaries, who exploit areas such as:
• corrupting and stealing sensitive information;
• denying services on telecommunications, commercial databases and websites; and
• damaging industrial control systems (ICS) such as supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA); distributed control systems (DCS) and programmable logic controls (PLC).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Evidence of cyber activity and an actor’s will to use it against the UK can be challenging to source and even harder to attribute. Attribution is difficult not only due to the disparate and anonymous nature of cyberspace, but because it is not solely a technical problem – the problem spans technical/tactical (how), operational (what) and strategic levels (why).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Assessing the level of threat from and through cyberspace can be achieved by understanding the sum of the following three factors.
a. Intent. Intent is the most critical component as it provides ‘intelligence-in-depth’ or context as to ‘why’ an adversary may act. An adversary’s intent can either be declared, demonstrated or a combination of both. In some cases, intent may be unknown so understanding will be based on observed activity.
b. Capability. Intelligence analysis focuses primarily on understanding the adversary’s strengths and their ability to generate and sustain them. However, whilst a capability may exist, there may be no intent or opportunity to use it.
c. Opportunity. Opportunity is the key variable in assessing threat as the opportunity to act can present itself in many guises and at any time. An adversary may also actively seek to generate their own opportunity to act, through a variety of influencing or shaping activities. Opportunities will be available through changes or variances in the environment, providing potential advantage to the adversary. An adversary could also drive friendly forces along a specific operational path resulting in potentially higher, repeatable risk. There may also be opportunities provided by friendly force activity more widely – their vulnerabilities provide avenues that threat actors can exploit to achieve their aims.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber attacks can appear in many guises, without necessarily inflicting visible or tangible material damage and are more easily deniable by the perpetrator. All of this significantly increases the likelihood that an adversary may seek to create effects through cyberspace. Cyber attacks currently have a lower political and public perception of aggression when compared with more traditional and visibly damaging attacks where lives or property are obviously and physically threatened. This is largely based on the fact that there have been no publicised, large-scale events (including the loss of life) that have been positively attributed to a cyber attack. Should such an event happen, this would likely change the public’s perception to the potential ‘aggressive’ nature of cyber attacks; it is the effect that is important not the means of delivery.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The term ‘threat actor’ is used to identify those who pose a threat. Threats to security in, and through, cyberspace include state-sponsored attacks, ideological and political extremism, serious organised crime, lower-level/individual crime, cyber protest, cyber espionage and cyber terrorism. Threat actors fall into six broad categories: nation states; terrorists; criminals; patriotic hackers; hacktivists; and insiders. To some degree each category of threat actor is supported by the actions of hackers, who use their skills to adapt and exploit computer software and systems for purposes unintended by the original creators. Each group’s membership can vary greatly in terms of sophistication, scale and motive and may pose differing types of threat. At all levels, the actor’s motivation is key, whether it is to:
• support national goals (either on behalf of, or directly for, a governmental body);
• generate income (either legitimately or through crime);
• improve personal technical skills; or
• support political ideals (hacktivisim).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Threat actors exploit cyberspace’s characteristics through innovative approaches that often have a low-entry cost and they are helped by the ease of access often presented to them. Such malevolent actors may seek to create uncertainty and mistrust through:
• direct access to people and systems;
• attacking and exploiting our national and economic infrastructures; and
• attacking military capabilities including command and control systems, logistical support and personnel.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Nation states. The most sophisticated threat is likely to come from established, capable states (or their proxies) who exploit cyberspace to gather intelligence on government, military, industrial and economic targets. Defence is particularly concerned when states:
• seek intelligence about UK military plans;
• steal intellectual property and intelligence on UK military capabilities;
• exploit UK military capabilities using their military and intelligence services with knowledge of the vulnerabilities of our capabilities;
• deny the UK use of its cyberspace communications channels;
• conduct subversive activities using their intelligence services; and
• use proxies or large numbers of synchronised and coordinated partisans to cover the true origin of their activities within cyberspace.
The theft of personal data from the United States Office of Personnel Management shows the alleged use of cyber operations by a state.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Terrorists. Terrorists, their supporters and sympathisers use cyberspace to spread propaganda, radicalise potential supporters, raise funds, communicate and coordinate plans. Such groups may also use cyberspace to facilitate or mount attacks against our critical national infrastructure.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Criminals. Criminals target the information on Defence and industries’ computer networks and online services for commercial gain (for example, contractual intelligence or intellectual property theft). They also target civilian and military personnel for fraud or identity theft. As government services and businesses transfer more of their operations online, the scope for potential targets will continue to grow. The impact that a cyber attack can have on e-commerce is illustrated by the drop in the Dow Jones Stock Exchange following false information concerning the President of the United States being posted in social media. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Patriotic hackers. Patriotic hackers act upon states’ behalf. During times of increased tension they aim to:
• spread disinformation;
• attempt to perpetrate attacks on, or block attacks by, perceived enemies of the state; and
• disrupt critical services.
The cyber attack against Estonia in 2007 shows the disruption that patriotic hackers can cause.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Hacktivists. Hacktivists are groups or individuals who seek to gain unauthorised access to computer files or networks to further social or political ends. They aim to:
• cause disruption, reputational, political and financial damage (for example, through releasing sensitive government information);
• gain publicity by attacking public and private sector websites and online services; and
• exploit social media to further their cause.
The attacks against Georgian and Western websites on the outbreak of the Russian military incursion into Georgia is a good example of the damage that can be inflicted against a state by hacktivists. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Insiders. Disgruntled or subverted employees may seek to deliberately exploit cyberspace to cause harm to their employer in a number of ways. Additionally, all personnel, regardless of their role or seniority,
are on the front line in cyberspace and can, accidentally, give an adversary the ‘in’ they need to Defence systems by ignoring or circumventing cyber security advice and procedures. The Bradley Manning, Edward Snowden and Jeffrey Paul Delisle cases show the threat posed by insiders.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Non-targeted threats. Although this chapter concentrates on targeted threats, there are numerous threats in cyberspace that are not specifically aimed at any one individual that could cause Defence harm. An example of a non-targeted threat is the Conficker virus, which caused significant disruption to the Ministry of Defence’s (MOD’s) information and communication technology (ICT) system.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are a number of cyber exploitation, attack tools and techniques freely available on the Internet. Adversaries traditionally employ four elements in an attack – vector, payload, behaviour and effect, all underpinned by intelligence.
a. Vector. This describes the method and route an adversary uses to form initial contact with the target in cyberspace. This could be through an email, a link on a web page, removable media, wireless media or getting local access to the system used by the target.
b. Payload. Payload is computer code that will impact the target system through exploiting vulnerabilities, enabling the adversary to establish access and/or interact with the target. Often the vector and payload are combined in the form of malware.
c. Behaviour. Behaviour describes the actions taken by an adversary to ensure the initial and enduring success of the vector and payload in their attack. Actions may include concealing adversarial activity, for example, being undetected in both system log audits and by anti-virus software. Adversaries will often delete or disguise evidence of their activities once the attack is complete.
d. Effect. The outcomes of a cyber attack may be physical, but the majority are created through the virtual and cognitive domains. Effects may vary depending upon the attacker’s intent and nature of the payload. Effects may include the following.
i. Direct action on the target system – for example, a denial of service (DoS) where an attacker aims to make a service or network unavailable to its users by overloading it with repeated requests for information or messages.
ii. Accessing a system, which not only gives the actor access to the information held by that system, but may also provide the means to investigate and exploit further onward connections.
iii. Accessing a system that may enable an adversary to render equipment useless, thus denying Defence the capabilities it relies upon to accomplish its missions.
iv. Theft of data and/or altering of data – for example, password theft, data theft for reputational impact or loss of intellectual property and changing the integrity of databases (such as financial, logistics, or personnel data) to provide false readings.
v. Changing the system’s functionality – for example, changing permissions, controlling hardware (such as webcams) or implanting malicious programmes. Functionality changes may also allow onward connectivity to other, potentially more interesting and valuable, information.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber offers additional vectors for an adversary to conduct traditional operations in support of espionage, subversion, and sabotage. Reach, asymmetric effect, anonymity/attribution, timing and versatility are the main properties that differentiate cyber threats and attacks from conventional ones.
a. Reach. Compared to the other environments, the relatively pervasive and borderless nature of cyber activities enables both global and local operations. It enables access to targets spanning the tactical to strategic.
b. Asymmetric effect. Cyberspace is able to reach many organisations and specific individuals. An individual, or relatively small organisation with appropriate motivation, limited resources and high technical capability could conduct an attack with strategic and/or large-scale effect (for example, disrupting communication channels).
c. Anonymity/attribution/deniability. The process of attribution identifies the actor who conducted or sponsored a cyber action against another state, organisation or individual and the intent behind it. Non-attributable attacks increase uncertainty and potentially reduce political risk and the opportunity for retaliation. The process of attribution can be difficult, which can make an actor’s use of cyber attacks more easily deniable.
d. Timing. There are two aspects to timing for cyber activity which we should consider.
i. The preparation time for an adversary can be short where access, anonymity, collateral damage or target complexity are not concerns; equally the time can be long where these are important considerations.
ii. The effects of cyber activity can be instant, triggered or purposely delayed. This provides a potentially very high operational tempo and a constant state of change.
e. Versatility. The impacts of some cyber attacks are potentially reversible or tailored, and this can determine the degree to which services are affected. For example, an attack that prevents power from reaching a factory could be stopped, allowing the factory to resume working. Such reversible effects could reduce the amount of temporary collateral damage and therefore make a cyber attack more politically and socially acceptable.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Encryption. The increasing and widespread use of complex encryption across multiple applications in cyberspace is one of the most concerning issues for intelligence and law enforcements agencies today. Once the preserve of states, encryption protocols are now available to those engaged in more nefarious activities, whether state or non-state sponsored. These protocols can be used across a range of commercial and personal applications that enable activities such as command and control and financial transactions. The issue of the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation’s attempts to force Apple to gain access to data held on Syed Rizwan Farook’s (one of the San Bernardino shooters) iPhone is a good example of the increasing impact of encryption.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
There are a number of forms of cyber attack which make up a cyber toolbox. A common feature is that the technical aspects of individual attacks frequently mutate on a daily basis. The cyber toolbox includes (but is not limited to) social engineering, malware, local physical access and supply chain corruption.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Social engineering. Social engineering is the manipulation of individuals to carry out specific actions, or to divulge information. The information gained is frequently used as an enabler of cyber attacks. As the adversary’s understanding of an individual’s social use of the Internet deepens, there is a greater threat to that individual through their online interactions. Operations security is particularly susceptible to social engineering tools and techniques as these exploit knowledge at the personal level, such as personnel using Facebook while on operations, giving details of where they are and what they have been doing. This may mean our adversaries become aware of our activities, dispositions, intentions, capabilities and vulnerabilities. An example of social engineering would be the targeting of friends of Admiral James Stavridis (Commander United States European Command and Supreme Allied Commander Europe) via social media to collect personality information.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Techniques. Social engineering is commonly used to enable the delivery of malicious software onto target systems. In many cases the threat actor using these methods will have carried out extensive research on the target to maximise their chances of success. They will try to find organisation charts, telephone details and email addresses, and will use social media to refine their knowledge about the intended victim. This enables the attacker to use personal references that build the victim’s confidence, making the victim more likely to comply with any requests. Some of the most commonly used techniques are outlined on page 31.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Social media. Significant data can be gathered and analysed from links made from social media applications. Technical collection of computer traffic patterns by third parties using commercially available software can provide information on location, strengths, movements of individuals and units, as well as morale and intentions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Malware. Malicious software, known as malware, is an overarching term for software that is designed to infiltrate or damage a computer. Malware’s effects can include:
• denial of service (DoS) intended to overload a system;
• recruiting the target system as part of a botnet (also known as becoming a zombie) which can result in launching a distributed denial of service (DDoS) on everyone/everything you’re connected to (for example, connecting to others using your address book);
• privilege escalation, where access is gained to a system and escalated to include the addition of admin/root privileges;
• keystroke logging – this uses a virus or physical device that logs a user’s keystrokes as they type, compromising data, passwords and credit card numbers;
• geo-location of smartphones, tablets, laptops and similar devices; and
exploiting social networks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Malware types. Malware has traditionally been designed to infect computers and computer networks. However, the rapidly increasing popularity of smartphones, tablets and other Internet-enabled technology provides new and appealing targets for malware developers. Some malware combines attributes into so-called ‘blended threats’ that are becoming difficult to detect and remove. Some of the types of malware available are described on page 33.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Access. Access is crucial to the success of any cyber attack and can be obtained in three ways: physical, close and remote.
a. Physical access is the ability to gain direct access to a computer or network, such as by connecting a USB device directly to a computer. Access can be gained in a number of ways, for example, posing as public officials or couriers delivering a package, or by tailgating staff. Once in the premises, intruders can interfere with ICT by installing software, such as keystroke loggers and remote access hardware to gain data from, or future access to, systems.
b. Close access is the ability to access to a computer or network from deployed platforms, people and equipment operating within the area of that network but do not have physical access. Typically this could be through use of the electromagnetic spectrum, such as connecting via Wi-Fi. Alternatively, close access can be achieved by an adversary through ‘baiting’.
c. Remote access is the ability to get access to a computer or a network from external locations (physical and virtual) that may be considered outside of that network.
If we can reduce the opportunities of an adversary to access to our cyberspace, then we can mitigate the success of potential attacks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Advanced persistent threat. An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a network attack in which an unauthorised person gains access to a network and stays there undetected for a long period of time. The intention of an advanced persistent threat attack is to steal data rather than to cause damage to the network or organisation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Supply chain corruption. Every effort should be made to verify the trusted supply of all components, including hardware and software, for Defence capabilities. However, unscrupulous and/or malicious suppliers may interfere with the supply chain resulting in untrusted or unaccredited equipment being delivered, which may not function properly, safely, and/or securely. Such interference can result in malware or maliciously modified hardware – such as a ‘backdoor’ – being embedded in newly delivered or recently repaired electronic equipment.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber operations can be categorised into four distinct roles:
• defensive cyber operations;
• offensive cyber operations;
• cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance; and
• cyber operational preparation of the environment.
These roles are rarely discrete. They are interdependent and interacting, providing support to, being supported by and placing constraints on each other. However, defensive cyber operations have primacy to protect our capabilities and enable our freedom of manoeuvre.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence does not deliver the full spectrum of cyber operations. Military cyber activity must be coordinated with key partners, such as:
• the Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA);
• Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ);
• Government Computer Emergency Response Team (GovCERT);
• Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure;
• Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) UK;
• other government departments;
• industry;
• academia; and
• international partners.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 confirmed a plan to create a National Cyber Security Centre that will provide the UK with a unified platform to handle incidents and will create a single point of contact in Government for the private sector. From a Defence perspective, the decision to create a Cyber Security Operations Centre staffed by experts underlines the importance placed on cyber and cyberspace.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defensive cyber operations secure the freedom of manoeuvre in cyberspace and are normally undertaken within an information assurance framework. defensive cyber operations (DCO) Active and passive measures to preserve the ability to use cyberspace.
Active defence. Activities that target hostile offensive cyber operations in order to preserve our freedom of manoeuvre within cyberspace. 
Passive defence. Threat specific defensive measures to reduce the effectiveness of cyber activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At the strategic level, defensive cyber operations assure the freedom of action by protecting infrastructure and deployed sovereign capabilities from adversarial offensive cyber activity. At the operational and tactical levels, they protect critical networks and systems that reside in the sea, land, air and space environments. Such control is likely to be localised in terms of time and space, and will be reliant on the quality of information assurance. Control of equity in cyberspace depends on available resources and the level of risk that can be tolerated. Defensive cyber operations are enduring and non-discretionary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Security. The National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015 makes it clear that the opportunities presented by cyberspace have also introduced new vulnerabilities. Security, both individual and collective, is therefore an overarching principle in cyber operations. A lapse in security can affect our resilience, awareness and destroy the trust of our partners. The link with operations security is critical as actions in cyberspace may take place over a prolonged period and any compromise could undermine years of effort. Within the cyber environment, everyone must apply judgement, take responsibility for their actions, understand regulations and respond to possible breaches in a timely fashion. The scale of damage that even one person can cause is illustrated by the Edward Snowden case.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Resilience. Dependence on the cyber environment dictates that Defence, commercial entities/contractors and our partners, must withstand or recover rapidly from difficult conditions. Defence must also deliver those capabilities and actions that are essential to operations. Resilience The ability of the community, services or infrastructure to withstand the consequences of an incident. (JDP 02, Operations in the UK: The Defence Contribution to Resilience, 2nd Edition) cyber resilience The ability of an organisation or platform to withstand and/or recover from malicious events in cyberspace.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Computer Emergency Response Teams. Most governments, many universities and industries run CERTs. In the main, these teams collaborate internationally on a voluntary basis to manage security aspects of cyberspace in near-real time. Most teams are members of the Forum for Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST). Within Defence, cyber protection teams (CPTs) protect mission-critical assets including networks, data, information and systems.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Offensive cyber operations include activities that project force to create, deny, disrupt, degrade and destroy effects in and through cyberspace. These operations may transcend the virtual domain into effects in the physical and cognitive domains. offensive cyber operations (OCO) Activities that project power to achieve military objectives in, or through, cyberspace.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Offensive cyber activity can be used to inflict temporary or permanent effects, thus reducing an adversary’s confidence in networks or capabilities. Such action can support deterrence by communicating intent or threats. At the operational/tactical level there is a need to coordinate between offensive cyber operations and information operations/activities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Offensive cyber activity can be simply categorised into seven phases, known as the cyber attack chain. These are commonly identified as:
• understanding;
• payload development;
• delivery;
• exploitation;
• installation;
• command and control; and
• effect achieved.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The phases are not discrete events, instead they interact and overlap with each other and may vary in duration. They are equally applicable to the actions of a state or criminal. They are also dependent upon an attacker’s intent and availability of offensive cyber and intelligence capabilities. A representative cyber attack chain is depicted at Figure 3.1 below.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (cyber ISR) comprises activities in cyberspace to gather active intelligence from target and adversary systems required to support military operations. The cyber ISR mission for Defence can be supported from national and/or single-Service capabilities. cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (cyber ISR) Intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance activities in, and through, friendly, neutral and adversary cyberspace to build understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Situational awareness is defined as: the knowledge of the elements in the battlespace necessary to make well-informed decisions. Accurate, detailed and timely intelligence is critical to military operations. Intelligence (including indicators and warnings) focuses on developing sound situational awareness and understanding by identifying trends and scanning for emerging threats, hazards or opportunities as well as understanding the consequences of any action. Cyberspace contains huge amounts of data which can be exploited and assessed for intelligence and situational awareness.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A recognised cyber operational picture, within a common operating picture, will provide commanders with enhanced situational awareness, improved understanding, decision support and enable decision-making. Producing a recognised cyber operating picture is challenging, the reason for which could be:
• lack of a traditional joint operations area;
• speed at which events occur in cyberspace;
• volume of activity that occurs in cyberspace;
• difficulty in proving attribution;
• difficulty in recognising network faults opposed to cyber attacks;
and
• locations in the physical and virtual cyber layers might vary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Indicators and warnings for Defence are often sourced through commerce (for example, anti-virus vendors or security operating centres) and the intelligence agencies. The Ministry of Defence’s (MOD’s) own CERT has prime responsibility for disseminating cyber indicators and warnings across Defence’s networks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The fourth role in cyber operations – cyber operational preparation of the environment (cyber OPE) – is a vital enabling function which significantly enhances the effectiveness of other cyber operations. The role is split into passive operational preparation of the environment tasks (which include maintenance and integrity of connections, networks and software) and the more covert active ‘infrastructure’ activities. cyber operational preparation of the environment (cyber OPE). All activities conducted to prepare and enable cyber intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, defensive and offensive operations. Information management
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Acquiring, sharing, processing and protecting information is a vital supporting function to the four roles of cyber operations. Acquiring and sharing information through covert and open sources to multiple or collective locations should be timely, but must also maintain data integrity. These activities are non-discretionary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Information assurance activities should provide commanders with the confidence that their networks and systems will protect the information they handle and function as they need to, when they need to and under the control of legitimate users.
a. The MOD Computer Emergency Response Team (MODCERT) is responsible for the information assurance of fixed and deployed networks.
b. Defence Assurance and Information Security (DAIS) is the Defence lead for information assurance. The Joint Information Assurance Coordination Cell (JIACC) coordinates all non-accreditation activity.
c. The Joint Security Coordination Centre (JSyCC) is part of DAIS, they conduct and coordinate all MOD information security incident management and related risk analysis activity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
An effective approach to information sharing and interoperability of cyber activity requires information and intelligence to be shared. A balance must be struck between the ‘need to protect’ for security and the ‘need to share’ for mission success. Operations security is critical for effective cyber operations and must never be compromised.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Much of the early and continuing cyber capability development is
a result of innovation from communities within other areas of traditional war fighting. These other capabilities (where data is understood and manipulated in other ways) can be referred to as cyber littorals. The nature of cyberspace is such that it is closely integrated with the maritime, land, and air and space environments (as shown in Figure 3.2) and has symbiotic relationships with other military capabilities. These include:
• information operations (Info Ops) and information activities;
• electromagnetic activities (EMA);
• signals intelligence (SIGINT); and
• communication and information systems (CIS).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
These capabilities use different approaches where data is both manipulated and understood. Such capabilities will need to be managed to achieve success on military operations.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Information operations and information activities. The first ‘cyber littoral’ area is that of information operations and information activities. Information operations and activities are closely associated with cyber capability and there is a large degree of subject matter overlap. The key distinguishing feature between the two areas is the scope of the operating environment. Whilst cyber operations take place in and through cyberspace, information operations can also use any of the operating environments to pursue its aims. We can use cyber and cyberspace to enable information operations and activities in a symmetric or asymmetric manner.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Signals intelligence. Cyber’s second symbiotic relationship is with SIGINT, which is defined as: the generic term used to describe communications intelligence and electronic intelligence when there is no requirement to differentiate between these two types of intelligence, or to represent fusion of the two. Cyber operations and SIGINT are, to an extent, reliant on the same infrastructures, organisations, accesses and personnel training and skill-sets.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Signals intelligence and cyber. The key difference between cyber and SIGINT comes in the intent and resultant effect of the two. The output of SIGINT primarily resides in the cognitive domain and is one of increased knowledge. Cyber effects will primarily be in the virtual or physical domain, although some may also be in the cognitive domain, as we seek to deny, disrupt, degrade or destroy. As with information operations/information activities and cyber, SIGINT and cyber co-exist, overlap and may even compete for resources – but they must be seen as complementary, not competing, capabilities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Electromagnetic activities. For the context of this Primer, EMA is limited to electromagnetic spectrum (EMS) operations and electronic warfare.
a. Electromagnetic spectrum. The EMS covers different types of electronic radiation from radio waves through visible light to gamma rays. From a military perspective, the EMS can be used indirectly, as a bearer for information, or directly as a means of creating an effect. It is in the former that the EMS and cyber have their relationship as electromagnetic energy enables the linking of computer networks and infrastructure.
b. Electronic warfare. Electronic warfare comprises electronic attack, electronic protection and electronic surveillance and is defined by NATO as: military action that exploits electromagnetic energy to provide situational awareness and create offensive and defensive effects.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Electromagnetic activities and cyber. The relationship between cyber and EMA should be seen as one of resilience and complementary in nature rather than as one of competition. Cyber and electromagnetic activities (CEMA) will, therefore, need to be delivered in an increasingly coordinated manner within Defence. Intelligently applying CEMA can create outcomes greater than the sum of their parts. For example, electronic attack could be used to herd an adversary’s communications onto a network already under surveillance. To improve the coordination between electromagnetic activities and cyber, Defence has created the Joint CEMA Group (JCG). A shared characteristic of EMA and cyber is the pace of development.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The final littoral relationship is with communication and information systems. With the advent of the information age, a large, but not exclusive, proportion of communication and information systems are computer based. Responsibilities within this function include security and resilience and this is where the overlap with cyber is greatest. Defensive cyber operations are an integral and non-discretionary component of network and security resilience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military cyber operations must be coordinated, synchronised and integrated across the strategic, operational and tactical levels of operations with all other military capabilities. These activities are part of Defence’s approach to full spectrum targeting processes. It recognises that other nations or actors, both friendly and adversary, may use cyber capabilities to enhance their own ability to achieve a degree of local, regional and/or international influence, which may otherwise be limited through other means.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Strategic effects. Cyber’s virtual and flexible properties mean that we can potentially create a variety of effects in terms of complexity and severity, and at a tuneable scale. Cyber is not affected by physical geography in the same way as other conventionally-derived effects and may offer options to hold strategic target sets at risk that otherwise would be unreachable. The 2008 Stuxnet attack against the Iranian nuclear programme is a good example of cyber enabling operations for strategic effect.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operational effects. Integrating cyber capability into operational level planning is a new and evolving process. We need a high degree of integration and cooperation with units and organisations that routinely operate at the strategic level to successfully create cyber effects within a campaign. It is entirely possible that cyber operations will have been taking place for some time, possibly years, before conventional forces are deployed. As these operations may be dependent on infrastructure and networks associated with, or even located within, physical target sets, we need to de-conflict and thoroughly understand the gain/loss balance to avoid fratricide and the compromise of ‘equity’. It may be possible to create the required effect using relatively low equity or open-source (or modified open-source) tools that can provide agile and flexible response options. Integrating cyber into operational planning is achieved through joint action which is a framework for considering the integration, coordination and synchronisation of all military activity within the battlespace. Joint action is implemented through the orchestration of:
• information activities;
• fires;
• outreach; and
• manoeuvre.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Tactical effects. At the tactical level, the time required to develop access and invest in capability may mean that creating high-end cyber effects is reserved for early or important actions that have a high pay-off. However, lower-level attacks (such as locally interfering with a single building’s network access and subsequently employing a low-end common payload) may increasingly be seen on operations. The Israeli integration of cyber operations into the conventional bombing of a Syrian nuclear research institute is a good example of the operational/tactical use of cyber.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Time. Cyber accesses often take years to develop. Knowledge of specific accesses and capabilities will be tightly controlled and held at the highest classification levels. Conversely, while this preparatory phase can take years, the execution phase may only take seconds. Similarly, in defensive terms, it may take far more people, time and resource to successfully protect and defend our own networks than for an adversary to launch a credible attack against them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber underpins so many aspects of Defence’s business that cyber command and control for Defence is complex. UK cyber doctrine describes Defence’s cyber command and control. The span of military, multi-agency and multinational partners conducting cyber activities means simple supported/supporting relationships are inappropriate. Instead, the commander and specialist staff must understand and manage multiple relationships, each of which is governed by particular freedoms and constraints. Government and industry must adopt a cautious but trusted partnered approach to cyber activity, orchestrated across strategic to tactical levels of command. This also applies to allies and coalition partners.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
By mainstreaming cyber, Defence is developing command and control and force structures to deliver and sustain cyber capabilities as part of its future force. The evolving Defence structure emphasises the complexity of conducting operations in cyberspace and our need to ensure actions are coordinated while retaining the flexibility and agility to manage the threats, and opportunities, arising from cyber.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
An adversary may conduct cyber attacks against all the elements of national power. An agile and resilient command and control approach will better survive and respond to the demands of such hostile activities. Command and control structures must also support cross-government and industry burden sharing. Further details of this will evolve as the UK Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CISP) develops. The Defence Cyber Protection Partnership (DCPP) will raise awareness and improve understanding of the cyber security risks. These partnerships highlight the need for protective measures to increase the security of the wider Defence supply chain and define an approach to implement cyber security standards.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The UK Cyber Security Strategy sets out our intention to secure the advantage in cyberspace by exploiting opportunities to gather intelligence and intervening as necessary against adversaries. Commanders should consider cyberspace to be an area of intelligence collection and analysis in its own right. Intelligence support to operations within cyberspace is essential to provide knowledge, reduce uncertainty, and support effective operational decision-making in defending Defence networks. It is not different to the intelligence support function on traditional operations – the outputs will include providing timely indicators and warnings.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cyber cannot be dealt with by one business, government department or agency alone. Each has their own specific responsibilities and expertise. Defence’s main aim is to protect its own systems and networks so that it can continue to carry out its missions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National cyber activities. The UK Cyber Security Strategy provides the strategic framework for all UK Government activity on cyber security. Government, business, the public and international partners all have a part to play because a coherent approach to cyber security is required. Protecting our own and other states’ critical national infrastructure, as well as providing advice to the public and industry, is a matter for other government departments and agencies. Key UK Government organisations are identified below.
a. Office of Cyber Security and Information Assurance (OCSIA) is a directorate in the Cabinet Office and provides strategic leadership across Government for UK cyber security issues. OCSIA works closely with the Government’s Chief Information Officer in the Cabinet Office.
b. Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) works in partnership with other government departments to protect UK national interests. Director GCHQ reports to the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs. Their primary customers are the Ministry of Defence (MOD), the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and law enforcement agencies.
c. CESG (a part of GCHQ) is the national technical authority for information assurance within the UK. It has the lead responsibility within government for providing advice on information assurance architecture and cyber security to the UK Government, critical national infrastructure, the wider public sector and suppliers to UK Government.
d. The National Crime Agency aims to prevent cyber crime and make the UK a safer place to do business. Legacy organisations which have been incorporated into the National Crime Agency are the National Cyber Crime Unit, Police e-Crime Unit and the Serious Organised Crime Agency.
e. Centre for the Protection of National Infrastructure (CPNI) is the government organisation that gives advice on physical, personnel and information security to businesses and organisations across the national infrastructure. It aims to reduce the vulnerability of organisations in the national infrastructure to terrorism and other threats, such as espionage, including those from cyberspace.
f. Computer Emergency Response Team UK (CERT UK) is the national-level organisation, established late 2013, which conducts cyber response and recovery across all government departments.
g. Government Computer Emergency Response Team
(GovCERT), provides warnings, alerts and assistance to public sector organisations regarding computer security incidents and advice to reduce exposure.
h. The National Cyber Security Centre, announced in the UK’s National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015, will provide the UK with a unified platform to handle incidents and will create a single point of contact within the UK Government for the private sector.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military cyber organisations.
a. Joint Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities Group. MOD established a new 1* Joint Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities Group (JCG) to coordinate activities in cyberspace and the electromagnetic environment to gain freedom of movement, operational advantage and create effect, whilst simultaneously exploiting, denying and degrading our adversary’s use of the same.
b. Joint Force Cyber Group. The Joint Force Cyber Group delivers Defence’s cyber capability; including the Joint Cyber Reserve. The Joint Force Cyber Group is subordinated to the Joint Cyber and Electromagnetic Activities Group.
c. Defence Assurance and Information Security (DAIS). DAIS is the Defence lead for information assurance. The Joint Information Assurance Coordination Cell (JIACC), within DAIS, coordinates all non-accreditation activity.
d. Defence Intelligence. Defence Intelligence provides timely intelligence products, assessments and advice to: guide decisions on policy and the commitment and employment of our Armed Forces; inform defence research and equipment programmes; and support military operations. Director Cyber, Intelligence, Information and Integration (DCI3), a serving 2* military officer, is responsible for cyber.
e. Joint Service Signals Organisation. The Joint Service Signals Organisation (JSSO) is a tri-Service MOD organisation that provides specialist support to military operations. As part of its role the JSSO conducts research into new communications systems and techniques to provide operational support to static and deployed MOD units.
f. MOD Computer Emergency Response Team. The MOD Computer Emergency Response Team (MODCERT) is responsible for the information assurance of fixed and deployed networks.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Operational staff. Operational planners and those responsible for targeting need to understand Defence’s cyber capabilities, and have access to legal advice. They need to either be trained in computer-related and physical interdependencies of information communication technology (ICT) or have access to subject matter experts.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Technical specialists. Technical specialists need current, expert knowledge of a range of operating systems and applications. Civilian training is supplemented by specialist military, government and commercial courses.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Specialist organisations. Defence’s cyber resources are centrally managed by the Joint Forces Cyber Group in consultation with the single Services and civilian agencies. Teams of cyber specialists will operate at different levels, have varying skill sets and be in geographically dispersed units. Manpower will be sourced from:
• in-house and external specialist trained personnel (regular and/or reserve);
• secondments from civilian companies; and
• service level agreements with contractors.
Operating in cyberspace
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defensive preparedness. All personnel working with ICT need to have the confidence to recognise, respond to and recover from cyber attacks. Policies and practices in accordance with Joint Service Publication (JSP) 440, The Defence Manual of Security and JSP 541, MOD Information Security and Computer Network Defence Organisation and Reporting Procedures need to be developed and rehearsed to manage our activities.
a. Systems security. Using appropriate warning systems, up-to-date anti-virus software and continuous ‘patching’ (updating) of operating systems/applications is the most common and effective form of preparedness. Similarly, educating and training operators will ensure they are aware of, and prepared for, the latest forms of attack. All personnel should be continuously asking themselves what their alternatives are if their computer systems fail. We all must, therefore, understand and practise business continuity plans. It is crucial that when planning against cyber attacks a wider, systems view is taken of potential problems and their solutions. For example, there is little value in protecting a critical computer controlling the fuel pump to the ship’s engines if the logistics systems are attacked to provide false fuel states. The entire system needs to be protected.
b. Security personnel. Operators of a computer system may not be best placed to apply cyber security to that system. Key security personnel (identified in advance) should be on a readiness rota. They should maintain links to the appropriate security procedures and teams (for example, CERTs and warning and reporting points (WARPs)). It is not uncommon to need to contact manufacturers or suppliers of a computer system when a cyber attack occurs. Contact lists should be maintained and the process tested. Again, business continuity plans must be maintained and practised.
c. Recovering from malware attacks. Malware is notorious for remaining in a system even though it appears to have been removed. Thorough cleansing is often a matter of opinion of the operators rather than a proven fact. Maintaining and installing verifiably clean backups, held off-site in a secure location, should be practised as part of normal operations. Attacks, and suspected attacks, should always be reported through the local chain of command.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Exercising the capability. Cyber needs to be exercised in the mainstream along with other capabilities so that users can develop understanding and resilience. Frequent, detailed and well-rehearsed actions in response to cyber attack will be exercised within the Defence Exercise Plan, managed by Joint Forces Command. Appropriate scenarios and practises for each level of command will differ and may change rapidly in line with the threat. Cyber response activity will need to be undertaken at all levels of training (individual, collective and joint). There will also be education as well as training aspects to this requirement. Cyber-related scenarios and injects are already being incorporated into joint exercises such as the UK’s Exercises JOINT HORIZON and JOINT VENTURE as well as those of NATO and allies. In addition, specialist cyber units are involved in exercises with partner nations and allies.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Business continuity. Business continuity means being resilient and maintaining service though any given kind of cyber incident – malicious or otherwise. By developing a plan based on risk, resilience, impact and interdependency assessments, the effects of any loss of service can be mitigated. Operators need to be made aware of which systems and, more importantly, what information/data is critical at which times during operations. When considering business continuity plans, the following questions should be considered.
• Where does the priority lie in maintaining system availability?
• What is the impact of system loss?
• Who do I need to notify if I intend to close a system – or continue running it with known or even unknown faults?
• How is risk measured and managed and at what levels of command do various responsibilities lie?
• What is the recovery plan?
• Is it frequently exercised using only back-up hardware, applications and data?
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding is defined as: the perception and interpretation of a particular situation in order to provide the context, insight and foresight required for effective decision-making. Understanding helps us to make decisions; it also helps us to manage any associated risks and any second and subsequent order effect
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In Defence, understanding underpins everything that we do. Understanding:
• informs our choices when developing state policy and strategy;
• supports the application of national power to achieve influence; and
• is a pre-requisite for effective decision-making.
Understanding helps us to identify the causes of conflict, the nature of emerging crises, and the context required for determining deterrence, coercion or response postures.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The national instruments of power are diplomatic, economic and military, all underpinned by information. Hard power is defined as: the threat or use of military or economic coercion or physical action to achieve influence. Hard power is, however, only effective if it is credible. Soft power is defined as: the ability to persuade or encourage others to adopt an alternative approach. Soft power may be used to influence others to adopt a preferred course of action through cultural and ideological means. By combining hard and soft power – sometimes referred to as ‘smart power’ – nations maintain their legitimate interests or demonstrate their values.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Influence is defined as: the capacity to have an effect on the character, or behaviour of someone or something or the effect itself. Defence contributes significantly in supporting the Government’s policy aim of influencing the behaviour of any group, nation or state that threatens the UK’s interests. However, to be successful in achieving this, we need to:
• make sure we are credible in our words and actions;
• use understanding to help us identify both who we need to influence, and how we might achieve that; and
• develop common understanding with those we work alongside.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding enables a global perspective, which supports the UK’s role as a global actor. Our interests are defined in the National Security Strategy and Strategic Defence and Security Review 2015, which identifies our national security objectives as:
• protecting our people;
• projecting global influence; and • promoting our prosperity.
Understanding helps us to avert or mitigate crises through identifying and enabling an early response to any threats to our legitimate interests.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The national perspective informs how Defence is configured and prepared, including how we develop our understanding and ability to operate with others to support national interests. However, global influences, including social, political, economic and cultural trends will also have an influence, so Defence cannot rely solely on its own perspective for understanding. Therefore, understanding should always be formed with the widest appropriate inputs to ensure we have the most comprehensive picture possible.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
National strategy provides guidance to Defence so we can make decisions for preparing, positioning and employing military capability. This demands that we understand foreign policy and home defence requirements, and we have the required force structures we need to meet them. National strategy also guides the intelligence efforts required to identify emerging threats. Commanders must base their decisions within the context of the national strategy, including considering threats to international security, foreign policy and the UK’s obligations. Understanding is necessary at all levels of command, because tactical activity can create strategic effect.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence is well-placed to contribute to national understanding. Defence support to national understanding falls into five broad categories.
a. Horizon scanning. Horizon scanning is defined as: systematic search across the global environment for potential threats, hazards and opportunities. Horizon scanning helps identify weaknesses in current assessments or policies, but it may not be sufficiently detailed to enable tasking requirements. At the national level, horizon scanning is led by the Cabinet Office.
b. Situational awareness. Situational awareness is defined as: generically, the understanding of the operational environment in the context of a commander’s (or staff officer’s) mission (or task). It is how Defence perceives a particular area of interest, problem or situation bounded by time and space in the context of a mission or task. Situational awareness provides the ability to identify what has happened and is happening, but not necessarily why it has happened. At the operational and tactical levels, commanders require situational awareness to analyse problems. Commanders and staff require situational awareness in sufficient detail and currency to support effective and timely analysis and, hence, make effective and timely decisions.
c. Support to policy, strategy and planning formulation. Understanding is essential for the formulation of effective policy and strategy and for the effective deployment of national resources. By setting the parameters for framing problems, understanding helps us to identify where there are gaps in our knowledge and determines where additional resources are required.
d. Contingency planning. Contingency planning is conducted within the Ministry of Defence (MOD) and military headquarters to prepare for potential military operations in areas of UK interest. Contingency planning provides commanders with a range of potential options which might have to be executed. Good contingency planning promotes proactive, rather than reactive, responses.
e. Defence Engagement. The UK maintains Defence assets designed to deliver hard power to defend the national interest. However, Defence assets have wider utility in maintaining our security and prosperity beyond the threat or use of hard power. Defence Engagement is defined as: the means by which we use our Defence assets and activities, short of combat operations, to achieve influence. Defence Engagement allows the military (alongside other instruments of national power) to play a part in shaping the environment, promoting the rules-based international order and preventing instability in support of the UK’s security and prosperity. This is done while building Defence’s understanding of the world. Defence Engagement enhances our understanding of other nations, their cultures and their strengths and weaknesses by:
• developing links with other nations’ militaries;
• strengthening alliances; and
• promoting the credibility of the UK within the international system through professional competence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding falls into three types. These are individual understanding, collective understanding and common understanding, which are explored below.
a. Individual understanding is defined as: the personal interpretation of the facts held by a person within their own mind. Individual understanding (even of the same problem) will inevitably vary across a group or population. Individual understanding is prone to being shaped by personal experience. Peer pressure can also affect individual understanding.
b. Collective understanding is defined as: the shared perspective held by members of distinct groups that have their own ethos, creed and identity. Members of specific institutions or professions have collective understanding ranging from professional standards or methods, to generally held perceptions of the institution’s role in the world. Collective understanding also arises in political, religious or ethnic groups. Organisational cultures, rituals, stories and norms will shape collective understanding.
c. Common understanding is defined as: the ability to comprehend perceptions of groups other than our own and to establish a common baseline for communication, interpretation and action. Common understanding is achieved when institutions, professions, communities and other groups cooperate for a purpose, or to co-exist. These groups may have different kinds of collective understanding that involves potentially divergent interpretations of the world and events, including views of one another. Working within, between and across multiple groups with their different understanding provides opportunities to be exposed to divergent views. Common understanding may be a settled compromise of different views.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Our collective understanding dictates how we develop our attitudes and opinions and how we behave or operate. It is our responsibility as individuals, as single Services and as professionals to understand ourselves, the world around us, and our potential adversaries. Understanding is one of the cornerstones of our military philosophy and we must want to understand. This philosophy embraces two principles.
a. A professional approach. Experience and knowledge, including the body of professional knowledge enshrined in doctrine, together with education and training, underpin effective understanding. This enhances both our ability to make timely and effective decisions and to take measured risk. We must seek knowledge, consider all available information sources (especially if they hold views opposed to our own) and conduct self-study as well as formal education and training.
b. A proactive approach to sharing information. Understanding depends on access to information and knowledge, but access is often problematic, particularly in the intelligence field where sources must be protected. The need for security may restrict information sharing, even when much of the same intelligence can be gleaned from open-source material; security caveats only apply once information is interpreted. The impact of any caveats may decrease as an environment and approach is created that enables intelligence sharing with those who need it.
(1) Sharing requires applying judgement, particularly regarding classification, and must be built upon trust.
(2) Sharing is resource intensive, requiring investment in information management and exchange systems, and relevant training. Being proactive is also an attitude of mind, and the approach to information may also extend to fostering individual, collective and common contacts.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding has a number of meanings depending upon the context in which it is used and the communities or institutions which develop it. Military understanding relates to what military forces need to understand to complete their missions, deliver operational success and, when necessary, identify, monitor and defeat adversaries.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding involves acquiring and developing knowledge to a level that enables us to know why something has happened or is happening (insight) and be able to identify and anticipate what may happen (foresight).
a. Insight. Developing understanding requires situational awareness to identify the problem. By analysing the context we can gain greater insight of the problem; applying judgement to this insight then generates understanding and in so doing may tell us why the situation has developed.
b. Foresight. Foresight will never be complete, but improving both the quality and analysis of our information will help to refine it.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Many decisions (especially those that are new or novel) can only be assessed with hindsight (understanding a situation or event only after it has happened). We should be careful to avoid using hindsight to support any claim that we ‘knew’ an outcome was inevitable (this is a very common mistake). Commanders should consider historic situations with outwardly similar parameters when framing new problems, but treat them with caution; while history may appear to recur, it never repeats.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Knowledge comprises the information and skills acquired through experience or education. Understanding, however, is about applying judgement to both make sense of, and recognise the significance of, facts in a given context. Table 1.1 illustrated the differences between knowledge and understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding requires the ability to transfer what we have learned to new and sometimes confusing settings. The ability to transfer our knowledge and skills effectively, and on our own, involves the capacity to take what we know and use it creatively, flexibly and fluently, in different settings or to different problems. Transferability is not merely ‘plugging in’ of previously learned knowledge and skills.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Building understanding takes time, and commanders may not have a comprehensive understanding at the outset of a crisis. While knowledge derived from information is a key source for building understanding, commanders should remain flexible and adaptive enough to consider views from a range of experts.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As factors including the context, the role of actors, politics and power can change over time, understanding is perishable. Evolving situations can present a challenge if insufficient time is available to develop, analyse or refresh our understanding. Commanders may have limited time to develop their understanding and accept that their responses to situations in an unfamiliar environment may result in greater risk, negative consequences or missed opportunities. This highlights the importance of recognising intended and unintended consequences, and the need to learn and adapt to improve our understanding.
a. Intended and unintended consequences. Potential consequences may be foreseen during planning in the form of best or worst case scenarios, and contingency plans developed accordingly. Unforeseen consequences will need to be addressed as they arise. Commanders should note that unintended consequences are not always negative and may provide opportunities for exploitation; understanding will enable opportunities to be seized.
b. The need to learn and adapt. Learning and adapting allows us to develop our understanding more quickly to account for the changing situation. Learning and adapting also enables:
• reduced likelihood of negative consequences;
• better mitigation of unforeseen consequences;
• more effective exploitation; and
• our ability to influence.
Developing a command culture that embraces a culture of learning and adaptation requires commanders to be both open-minded and able to learn from their own mistakes, as well as allowing their subordinates to make their own mistakes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
To develop understanding, commanders must clearly articulate their requirements. Commanders may have direction from a higher authority that frames thinking about a problem, and this will influence their intelligence requirements. A commander’s own knowledge, analytical skills and the command climate they foster each shape the level of understanding that will be achieved. Commanders should ask the following questions as a situation develops:
• what do we want to understand;
• how soon do we need to understand;
• what do we know;
• what are the potential gaps in our knowledge;
• how do we fill those gaps;
• how do we achieve continuity; and
• how do we improve the level of detail?
Annex 1A provides a summary of how to develop understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
An inherent characteristic of understanding is its competitive nature. This may involve individuals and groups competing for the primacy of their own individual or collective understanding. This applies equally to our own internal collective and common understanding, as much as it does to our allies’, other government departments’, host nation’s or our adversaries’ understanding. However, commanders should guard against thinking of understanding as a finite resource. Understanding is not a zero-sum commodity, where if someone understands, someone else does not.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Deployed commanders may have to overcome the relative advantages in understanding enjoyed by local actors. Individuals or groups may compete for authority over, or ownership of, various information or knowledge sources that contribute to understanding. This places an emphasis on developing networks together with the requirement to share information when practicable.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Narratives are spoken or written accounts of events. Narratives can dominate collective thought, and once ingrained can be very hard to shift. Moreover, narratives can be formed by imagination, myth and stories rather than fact, especially over time. The concept of the narrative can play a significant role in understanding; understanding the nuances that have contributed to widely-held beliefs can be very difficult to achieve.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Based on their comprehensive understanding of the situation, our adversaries will seek influence among local, regional and world audiences through their own narrative. Our narrative may be so different to our adversaries’ narrative, they may never be reconciled. This is commonly termed ‘competing narratives’. This places a premium on our ability to understand how people think, recognising both individual and cultural differences. Therefore, we may need to develop culturally-sensitive narratives that may not be our preferred option.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Some actors or groups will see any form of external intervention as an affront, complicating our ability to challenge a competing narrative. While competing narratives may never be fully reconciled, understanding (and much more importantly, not misunderstanding) can help us to identify common ground.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Misunderstanding differs from not understanding. Misunderstanding may occur between actors; it is easy to interpret information based on your own heuristics, biases and experience to make sense of them, but these may differ from another’s. As misunderstanding often arises from making incorrect conclusions, misunderstanding may result from difficulties in communicating. Using common languages, narratives, agreed lexicons and shared doctrines can help to overcome these difficulties. Genuine misunderstanding should not be reprimanded – making sense of, and fusing, numerous facts in complex environments is not easy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Language, and how we use it to articulate ideas, has a strong influence on perception and understanding. Specialist language may help to reduce ambiguity and can allow communication to be more precise, but it relies on a common understanding. Therefore, specialist language can be unintelligible to those not used to using it. Non-verbal communication, ‘body language’, is equally as susceptible to (sometime very subtle) cultural nuances that can impede understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Successful communication depends ultimately on our ability to understand what is meant rather than what is said. The military in particular tend to be opaque to other organisations through over-use of specialist language and acronyms. Commanders must be aware of this tendency and encourage the use of plain, concise language, particularly in multinational and multi-agency environments.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The principles of understanding detailed below aim to improve awareness
of our own strengths, weaknesses and biases. They also promote our capacity to recognise and consider the views of other actors and the need to think creatively and open-mindedly about problems.
a. Self-awareness. We should be aware of why or how we know something (as opposed to thinking something) and the limitations to certainty that knowing entails. Subconscious knowledge may be so engrained that it is difficult for us to both recognise and assess it. We should regularly audit our knowledge for its assumptions, origins and composition, taking into consideration our own biases and perceptions.
b. Critical analysis. Critical analysis is defined as: the intellectual discipline that applies deliberate introspective judgement to interpret, analyse and evaluate a problem and explain the context upon which that judgement is based. Critical analysis is subject to the same biases and perceptions as those inherent in developing understanding and it relies on intellectual integrity. Tools such as creating analogies and red teaming should be used as common practice to encourage individuals and groups to apply critical analysis.
c. Creative thinking. Creative thinking is defined as: the examination of problems or situations from an original or unorthodox perspective. Background, training and experience can often create conditional thinking, which may be prejudicial to critical analysis. Creative thinking should be encouraged to examine a situation from a fresh perspective and to create imaginative and competing hypotheses. Hypotheses should be tested against existing information to deduce meaning, or to develop alternative solutions.
d. Continuity. In areas where change is slow, or the requirement is enduring, developing and maintaining understanding requires continuity in observation and expertise. Achieving continuity requires us to:
• develop an effective network of sources to provide access to the knowledge needed;
• create a common way of storing and sharing knowledge; and
• share insight between relevant subject matter experts.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Defence must work with departments from across government and engage across the full range of state and non-state actors. The Whole Force approach comprises a mix of regular, reserve, contractor and civil service personnel, each with different backgrounds, experiences and knowledge. To ensure that our human capital is fully leveraged, and diverse thinking is captured, commanders must include all stakeholders in their analysis of problems and be open to new thinking. Working together may demand working with another nation’s information and intelligence agencies. The ‘need to know’ principle endures, but a collaborative environment relies on information sharing (the ‘need to share’), underpinned by pragmatic risk-management. Working together helps to build a collective narrative: however, commanders should be aware of the potential for groupthink resulting from working together, which may distort analysis.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Fusing information requires agreeing a common set of rules and procedures between the agencies involved. A key element of fusion is the ability to corroborate sources or specific pieces of information. Some information or intelligence will not be coherent. The key to understanding is recognising why information that does not fit now may later take on significance. Successful fusion is based on:
• interoperability through a number of organisations working together within a shared framework of understanding; and
• integration through the use of fully integrated systems with shared operating protocols and management.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Networking is important to generate understanding and offers significant benefits including the potential for greater objectivity, burden sharing and innovation. Networking also serves to engender trust and helps us identify common risks. Successful networks combine the knowledge and experience of contributors and help to establish and maintain personal relationships. Networks may develop naturally or through a deliberate process, and they may share information on a regular basis without a firm agenda. However, commanders should guide their staff on the need to balance less structured networking with the requirement for some discussion to be more formally documented. Commanders should also remember that individuals representing intelligence agencies may face constraints on what they can contribute to understanding.

Analysis is the detailed examination of something to help us interpret or explain it. Analysis in itself is not understanding, but is an essential component in the process of converting situational awareness into understanding. We can use analysis to evaluate information about the current and past behaviour of a state, system, organisation or individual. Analysis tests and refines hypotheses about future behaviour, including responses to our behaviour, and enables decision-makers to evaluate potential courses of action as fully as possible. The analysis process comprises the following stages.
a. Collation. Collation is the first stage in analysis, grouping together related items of information or intelligence to provide a record of events and facilitate further processing.
b. Evaluation. Evaluation involves appraising an item of information in respect of the reliability and credibility of the source and the information.
c. Integration. Integration involves a structured review to identify significant facts for subsequent interpretation using a variety of tools and techniques. The techniques chosen should ensure that the approach to a particular problem or issue is robust and not subject to cognitive or institutional biases.
d. Interpretation. Interpretation judges the significance of new information in relation to the current body of knowledge. It is used to provide a final assessment and to integrate other relevant information or intelligence to identify patterns.
e. Continuous review. Understanding is continuous; therefore, the analysis from which it derives must also be continuous. An assessment that is fixed in time has limited utility and a review process ensures that we will recognise, learn and adapt to changes in circumstances.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Analytical frameworks help us identify the context, social factors and stakeholders in a given situation. When selecting an analytical framework, the focus must be on whether it provides the appropriate degree of detail. The following frameworks help us to gain a wide perspective on problems.
a. PEST – political, economic, social and technological.
b. PESTLEI – political, economic, social, technological, legal, environmental
and information.
c. PMESII (PT) – political, military, economic, social, infrastructure and information (physical terrain and time).
d. STEEPLEM – social, technological, economic, environmental, political, legal, ethical and military.
e. ASCOPE – area, structure, capabilities, organisation, people and events.

The operating environment is defined as: a composite of the conditions, circumstances and influences that affect the employment of capabilities and bear on the decisions of the commanders. Within the operating environment the nature of war remains constant, but the character of conflict itself changes. Therefore, while we hope to learn from experience, this must be tempered by anticipating change. Whenever a crisis arises, the character of the operating environment will determine possible courses of action. Developing and maintaining an understanding of the operating environment is a critical element in identifying future challenges.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders who understand the operating environment are better able to:
• develop an appreciation of the actors within an environment;
• help develop alliances or agreements;
• develop empathy with another individual, group or community;
• write policy, strategy and plans;
• make better-informed decisions; and
• achieve influence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
As understanding is contextual, it is perishable and requires continual development to maintain its validity. Understanding can arise from internal and external sources.
a. Internal sources include our own formal education, historical precedent and practical experience.
b. External sources can be sub-divided into two broad categories – regulated and unregulated.
(1) Regulated sources include intelligence agencies and other agencies that control both their own sources and the intelligence they share.
(2) Unregulated sources include, amongst other things, the media and the Internet.
Commanders should be aware of favouring regulated sources over unregulated sources, as the validity of the data may be sound, or flawed, from either.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The joint intelligence preparation of the operating environment (JIPOE) helps commanders develop their understanding of the operating environment and is a basis for planning. Drawing on the joint intelligence estimate, it focuses the intelligence effort and prioritises intelligence requirements. The JIPOE is a living product and as well as contributing to the early stages of the operational estimate, it assists in conducting the operation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We are likely to face a congested, cluttered, contested, connected and constrained operating environment. The operating environment impacts the decisions we make regarding the types of capabilities we need to both develop and maintain understanding. The speed and quality of data flow may provide commanders with significant amounts of information. This places additional requirements on commanders and their staff who should consider the following factors.
a. Information and communications technology. Information and communications technology will continue to affect the way that we share and fuse information. The increasing volume of information available will have to be prioritised and analysed. Creating networks to help share this burden and enable understanding is a complex process. To help enable the process, commanders should seek to use common operating methods to enable information sharing wherever possible.
b. Information quality control. Commanders should ensure that processes are in place to control the quality of information. Unregulated external information may inhibit our understanding. Our adversaries will exploit all information, including any that we release. This emphasises the need for quality control, placing demands on our ability to collate, analyse and understand information.
c. Automation of the analysis process. Technological advances will further automate the analysis process. While automated analysis offers significant increases in the speed of processing, it can also incur risk. Technology can fail, and analytical processes that rely solely on logic lack judgement, intuition and human empathy.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The human factors that affect the operating environment can be broken into four areas for analysis, the:
• culture that affects how people interpret and orient themselves towards that environment;
• institutions that embody cultural ideas as practices;
• technology and infrastructure that people assemble to survive in their environment; and
• physical location in which people live.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The four areas described above overlap significantly. Considering the role of people as actors in isolation on the global stage – as states, non-state actors, populations, organisations, groups and individuals – provides insufficient depth to develop understanding. Commanders must analyse each area both in isolation and how they interact locally, regionally and internationally. Beyond that, commanders must consider where they can create effects and lever influence within the operating environment. Some facets may be so culturally distant from us that there is little common ground; others are universal, for example, the need for security and food.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Culture includes the general and pervasive ideas of a society: language; historically-rooted concepts of collective identity; and fundamental existential and moral beliefs such as those provided by religion. Culture may be sub-divided into two categories.
a. Ideology. Ideology concerns common ideas, language, rituals and theories providing a common bond for communities such as tribes, religious groups and ethnic groups.
b. Psychology. Psychology concerns the mental and emotional state, and behaviour, of individuals or groups and their interrelation. It concerns what motivates them, their fears, attitudes and perceptions, and how these factors affect the courses of action available to them. It relates to the notion of competing narratives of individuals and groups with different interests and needs, which sometimes join in a common cause.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Institutions embody ideas such as practices and conventions that form the landscape of social life. This includes political institutions, law and judicial machinery, and bonded communities such as families, clans and tribes. It also includes criminal associations and dissident groups operating outside of institutional conventions. Institutions can be broken into four categories.
a. Political. The political system within which a population operates and may include global, regional, national and provincial systems.
b. Military. The system and allegiances within which military personnel operate, their reputation at home and abroad, their relationship to the political environment and the capabilities, structures and equipment they can bring to bear in support of the state.
c. Economic. The economic bodies and organisations that influence the material prosperity of an area. This also covers the ability to produce and distribute goods, their consumption, and providing financial services. Economic considerations can be local, national or international and are linked to the political environment.
d. Legal. These are the institutions that oversee the international and national laws applicable to a state, community or organisation. This includes institutions such as the courts and judiciary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Analysing the technology and infrastructure essential for day to day life will help us to understand how communities shape the environment to suit their needs. This includes physical artefacts such as communications systems and infrastructure, roads, irrigation and buildings. Analysing technology should consider the level of technical and scientific development and supporting infrastructure within the environment, including:
Analysing the technology and infrastructure essential for day-to-day life will
• transport;
• manufacturing;
• energy generation;
• financial technology;
• information and communications technology;
• cyber capability;
• media; and
• military technology including sensors, weapons and intelligence gathering.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Analysing where people are located will contribute to a commander’s understanding of the situation. Factors should include terrain, climate and access to resources.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Analysing actors must go beyond the traditional characterisation of friendly forces, enemy forces and civilians. Some actors may change position, perhaps frequently, and may appear friendly and adversarial at the same time depending on their motivations. Motivation is based on a combination of self-interest, values, ideology, survival and fear. Those same factors affect our own position in relation to different actors.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Actors can be categorised in four ways – state actors, non-state actors, global actors and local actors.
a. State actors are individuals or group actors aligned with or representing their state. State actors include:
• governments and government agencies (political, military and economic);
• state-controlled industries (such as defence industries or utilities providers in some states); and
• state representatives in global organisations or alliances.
b. Non-state actors are individuals and groups that are independent of a state. Non-state actors include:
• state aspirants (for example, Palestinians and Kurds);
• independent groups (such as non-governmental organisations); and
• individuals (such as lobbyists, philanthropists, criminals, refugees and displaced persons).
c. Global actors operate and have influence at the global level. These include:
•  groups of states working together through a formal and legal body (such as the United Nations, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the Association of Southeast Asian Nations or the African Union);
• transnational companies and multinational corporations;
• global organisations (for example, the nuclear protest movement); and
• individual actors who transcend their own state affiliations.
d. Local actors possess the ability to hold a common or collective perspective at the lowest level within or without the formal state structure. Local actors include communities based on regional, provincial, town, village, family, ethnic or tribal lineage. They also include communities based on criminal activity and those supporting warlords.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We are all members of multiple groups, whether we are born into them (for example, families or ethnic groups), assimilate into them (for example, as members of political parties, or jihad supporters) or achieve status (for example, with higher education or profession).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Being part of a group usually means acting according to the rules or norms of that group, whether these rules are explicit or implicit. Each group we are a member of influences what we believe and how we behave. Individuals behave depending on the context they find themselves in.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Most people do not remain a member of the same groups throughout their life, instead they will join or leave groups either by choice or circumstance. In most societies, people change group allegiance when they move jobs or home, marry, vote for different political parties or make new friends. Even seemingly fixed groups (such as families or tribes) can change within a lifetime, through marriage or other formal arrangements with new groups. It is therefore inaccurate (and potentially dangerous) to view personal group memberships as fixed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders must understand that individuals are not members of just one group. Therefore, allegiance to rules and norms are seldom fixed and can change through context and circumstance.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Leaders at all levels should establish and maintain a climate that enables the continuous development of understanding. They should create an atmosphere that encourages open-mindedness, critical analysis and creative thinking. The command climate should enable staff to tell commanders what they need to know, even if it appears to contradict the commander’s views. However, this is a two-way process and commanders should clearly articulate their requirements for understanding and trust their staff to deliver.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Perception involves forming a view of something through intuition or interpretation of available knowledge. Internal sources, education, our experiences and prior beliefs shape the way we individually perceive situations. The fact that we are shaped by our perceptions reinforces the first principle of understanding: the need for self-awareness. However, there are limitations to perceptions. Our initial perception may be flawed or wrong because of biases in interpretation, inaccurate intelligence, false information or deception. There is also a tendency to look at a problem from only one standpoint. Commanders should recognise the impact that perceptions can have on the development of understanding and their decision-making process. Similarly, other actors have their own perception of a situation on which they base their actions. Commanders should strive to understand others’ perceptions and the narratives they develop from them, as well as their own. Commanders should consider:
• the scope of the problem;
• their own initial perceptions;
• what they believe or know to be the views of the other actors;
• how to identify those issues on which views are similar and those on which they diverge;
• how to identify, and close, the gaps in their understanding; and cultural awareness.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cultural awareness is critical to understanding, requiring us to develop cultural expertise in areas where we are likely to operate, together with a more general awareness of other cultures. On multinational operations, commanders should also consider the wide cultural differences that may exist within an alliance. Commanders should ask the following questions to understand the operating environment.
a. What defines the cultures (dominance, basic ideology, beliefs and practices)?
b. What are the ‘dos and don’ts’ (accepted behavioural norms)?
c. Who can tell us what we need to know (specific sources from that culture)?
d. How can we exploit greater knowledge of the culture to our advantage
(application)?
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Advice may also be available from other sources with varying levels of cultural awareness. Commanders may receive advice from specialists, both military and civilian.
a. General awareness. General awareness requires an active approach to learning more about different cultures. Providing lectures on culture during initial pre-deployment training for personnel, before they enter an operational theatre, is one example of general cultural awareness familiarisation.
b. Awareness competence. Awareness competence is gained through proximity to a culture and may be achieved during an extended operational tour. A daily requirement to interact with another culture either directly (where basic language skills have been achieved) or, more likely, through an interpreter, requires confidence, interest and a willingness to succeed. This approach can deliver a degree of cultural competence which can develop over time into expertise. Commanders and key staff should aspire to this level of personal cultural awareness competence.
c. Cultural expertise. Cultural expertise requires immersion in another’s culture and generally develops in concert with the ability to speak the language and to understand their mindset. Developing expertise is a long-term process, requiring opportunities for immersion and proximity to the culture, as well as continuity. Selecting individuals for such opportunities should focus on their aptitude and availability to develop such expertise; the attributes may not necessarily be those required in other aspects of military life. Commanders must recognise the value of cultural expertise; true cultural experts are invaluable.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Developing understanding is supported by information management, education and training, and collaborative networks.
a. Information management includes the physical aspects of managing information (personal and staff management procedures) and the technical aspects (procurement, operating systems, technical support and upgrades). Physical information management aims to present relevant information to commanders to enable effective decision-making and to protect commanders from the negative impact of information overload. Several factors should be considered.
• What information is essential that we protect?
• What are the priorities for information and intelligence?
• How much detail is required to allow a decision to be made?
• Which key decision-makers who need the information?
• What resources are available and for how long?
• How best to balance the need to circulate information to enable understanding and the need to maintain security (including operations security) and to protect sources and methods?
b. Education and training enable understanding. Command and staff training must advance the skills that develop understanding; this should promote self-awareness, critical and creative thinking skills and open-mindedness. For a specific operation, subject matter experts will undergo specialised training. All other personnel should undertake pre-operational deployment training that includes a focus on cultural awareness and skills that enable military personnel to interact with the operating environment.
c. Collaborative networks. The single intelligence environment aims to establish a collaborative network that fuses all sources of intelligence to provide a common resource within the contemporary operating environment.
(1) A single intelligence environment will allow better adaptation to complex environments and the changing requirements for intelligence over time.
(2) Establishing networks requires significant investment in education and training, and the technical solutions to make it viable.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In a crisis, our initial understanding could be limited. We are likely to know the location of the problem, the general nature of the situation, the rough time frame during which it has been developing and have a broad idea of the information sources we will need to access. We will develop and build on that initial understanding by defining more accurately the requirement for further knowledge, establishing networks and selecting the most effective analytical tool. Analysis allows us to construct a more accurate perspective of the human factors that affect the operating environment and enhance our understanding of how the separate environments interact with one another. This then allows us to identify what effects we can create, and who we can or cannot influence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
It is very difficult to test understanding. Understanding cannot be observed, but can only be inferred by behaviours such as contextualising, comparing and contrasting, and analysing. 
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The following list of activities provides a summary of how to develop understanding.
a. Clearly articulate the requirements.
b. Self-awareness: knowing ourselves as individuals and as organisations;
and understanding our own strengths, weaknesses, prejudices and perceptions.
c. Learn how our own cross-government approach and relationships work, how they may be improved, and how departments may gain a better appreciation of each other’s efforts.
d. Research our own culture, society and the wider population and their perceptions of us and what we do, and how this impacts on political and military decision-making.
e. Analyse our partners and allies; understand their interests, intent, values and best practice.
f. Establish situational awareness by collating information and intelligence already available; this represents initial understanding.
g. Determine what type of understanding you require. This might be to understand something for your own decision-making or to achieve collective or common understanding to try and influence others.
h. Develop strategic understanding, appropriate for national leaders, or tactical-level understanding.
i. Frame the context in which we may be intending to operate.
j. Connect the aims of the strategy, operation, mission and/or role and how it fits into the bigger picture.
k. Study the culture, traditions, population and society of the country/ countries in which we may operate, or from whom we may request support, or with whom we wish to remain neutral.
l. Promote (through example) the value and importance of personal relationships with other actors throughout the operating environment.
m. Develop a vision, intent and narrative and share it with staff and partners within a command climate conducive to developing understanding.
n. Encourage staff to challenge the accepted wisdom.
o. Build a network of information sources to answer your questions
and provide specific knowledge; use all available resources, including headquarters staff, intelligence organisations and subject matter experts.
p. Encourage working together and open-mindedness.
q. Analyse the human factors that affect the operating environment based on the cultural, institutional, technological and physical factors in relation to the actors.
r. Identify how to achieve influence (for example, using hard or soft power to affect the adversary’s decision-making).
s. Identify actors and their motivations, affiliations and needs. From this analysis, determine where internal and external narratives may compete.
t. Learn from the consequences of decisions made and adapt when necessary.
u. Remain aware that understanding is perishable and must be constantly refreshed.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding informs decision-making and it follows that the better our understanding, the better-informed our decisions will be. Decision-making is not a wholly rational activity and multiple influences will affect our judgement. Chapter 2 does not explain how to make decisions. Rather, it outlines the key components of decision-making (information, problem solving, how people think, using and influencing thinking, team dynamics and learning) to offer guidance for commanders and staff. This chapter reflects the principle of doctrine: it does not outline what to think, but rather how to think. Annex 2A discusses organisational learning and adaptation, and Annex 2B discusses biases and heuristics.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
A conceptual framework for thinking can help to find and then apply the right thinking strategy to a particular situation. Figure 2.1 depicts a framework with two thinking dimensions – ways and means. No single way of thinking is better than the other. Divergent ways of thinking that explore, develop options, generalise and use inductive reasoning can both complement and contrast with convergent ways that conclude, decide, deduce and deconstruct.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The means of thinking (the resources applied) contrasts conscious methods (applying logic, analysis, rules and procedures, and scientific method) with unconscious methods (intuition, creativity, insight, social understanding, instinct and heuristics).
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The broad spectrum of Defence utility means that we must be prepared to engage in a wide range of activities from war fighting to peacekeeping. Such activities may have to be done concurrently, in different locations, within different contexts. The operating environment is often referred to as complex, with much written to suggest it will only become more so. Complex military operations (operations consisting of many different and connected parts) are not a new phenomenon. Wrongly, complexity has come to be synonymous with difficult to understand.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders are increasingly required to work with civilian partners and this more inclusive approach is not just cross-governmental; it is a key element for all those with a stake in operations. The typical breadth of inter-agency and multinational engagement increases the complexity of problem solving, but diverse perspectives across a complex network can also generate significant opportunities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Military decision-makers should consider the following with respect to information.
a. Data proliferation. Modern information and communications technology has increased the amount of readily available data. The ability to supply, process and transmit this data raises expectations and demand for even more information. Technology has enhanced the range, speed and bandwidth of information bearers, resulting in the ability to manipulate large amounts of information. However, this does not necessarily enhance understanding or the ability to exploit the information for decision-making. The volume of information, the requirement to integrate numerous sources and speed of reaction can result in information overload and decision paralysis.
b. Technological dependency. Technology continues to transform the information flow in the battlespace, providing commanders with new capabilities to lever operational advantage. However, over-relying on specific technology, applications or bearers to deliver mission critical information, can lead to single points of failure. Advances in technology may lead to an over-estimation of its ability to enhance sensing, thinking and understanding. Technology should be exploited to facilitate understanding, but a technological approach does not necessarily serve the more people-centric approach required for complex operations.
c. The media. The reach of global media both facilitates and complicates our ability to influence and manage perceptions, both within and external to the operating environment. Media reporting of apparently minor events can create significant interest, placing an additional burden on deployed personnel to understand the potential implications of their actions. Commanders must contend with multiple audiences simultaneously – domestic, allied, in-theatre, regional and global – by tailoring their messages.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The solution to bounded problems may lie in a consistent approach based on precedent or process, but unbounded problems demand a more innovative response. Approaching unbounded problems using individual or single institutional frameworks may prove unsuccessful if the nature of the problem demands creative or novel thinking. To encourage collaboration and creativity, commanders facing unbounded problems must first consider asking questions rather than focusing on answers. Outcomes of actions are particularly uncertain in complex environments and with wicked problems. It does not follow that a repeated action will generate the same outcome it did on the first occasion. Time criticality and stress
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Training, education and experience allow us to base our decision-making in time-critical situations largely on intuition, rather than on deliberate reasoning or analysis. Forming patterns and mental templates from realistic training and operational experience allows us to associate current problems with past examples and to select appropriate options. Adopting certain practices (procedures, using checklists and challenge teams) can help to overcome biases inherent in these intuitive approaches to problem solving. The approaches relevant to tactical situations and the more deliberate analysis applicable to operational design and strategic thinking may differ.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Heuristics are cognitive ‘rules of thumb’ that allow us to make quick mental calculations that are necessary for quick decisions and responses. An awareness of cognitive biases and heuristics has been shown to help people avoid their effects, particularly for people of high intellectual capabilities. A summary of some key heuristics and biases is provided at Annex 2B.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Decisive, fast-acting leadership may be appropriate in the initial response to a crisis; initial judgements and first impressions apply to many aspects of problem solving. Problems at the operational level of command tend to be less structured and may require divergent thinking to provide novel or creative solutions. Mental and procedural templates for such problems may prove ineffective.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Successful organisations evolve to develop a range of resources to manage complexity. They facilitate the development and sharing of specialist knowledge and skills to resolve complex challenges. However, competition for resources between and within organisations and self-serving intra-organisational interests may impede rational thought. Moreover, at the highest levels of an organisation, assumptions can be shared and consequently ‘mutually reinforced’. Commanders should guard against this tendency for decision-making by consensus.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
It may not be helpful to consider ‘military culture’ as a single entity. All three of our single Services have distinct cultures that shape their attitudes and behaviour. Each has a strong culture that conditions how they perceive the external environment, the challenges that they face and their potential responses. This affects the way we interact with each other, with external agencies, and the way we operate. Military culture can have a positive impact: loyalty, trust, cohesion and shared values have a positive impact on our ability to make decisions and enact them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders must account for the resulting biases when operating in a joint environment and recognise that perceptions and bias can be even more prevalent and entrenched when working with allies or occasional partners. Open-mindedness and a willingness to challenge our own perceptions and ideas are vital in the multinational and inter-agency environments. Patience and listening skills are key, as is the ability to grasp different perspectives. Commanders should plan to operate at a tempo that allows time to develop such perspectives.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Thinking is a mental activity that allows us to understand, plan, reason, solve problems, innovate and make decisions. However, the thinking required in all these tasks is not the same type. Long-term planning does not use the same mental resources as short-term planning and a person’s thinking will not be equally effective in all tasks. Commanders may encounter circumstances in which their own and their staff’s thinking could be, for example, more imaginative or less vulnerable to mistakes. Unless we have some awareness of how we think, we cannot begin to mitigate potentially adverse effects.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding how thinking fails allows us to develop ways of avoiding such failures. Comprehending how thinking works allows us to create the best conditions for thinking through training and education, selection and the equipment design, processes, organisations, doctrine and information. In sum, training, mental discipline and rigour are key components for good analytical thinking, while intuitive thinking relies on the right conditions, knowledge, an uncluttered mind, positive emotions and confidence.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cognition is a term used by psychologists to describe the acquisition, storage, retrieval and use of information or knowledge. This takes place within a brain that has evolved specialised structures and functions that predetermine the ways in which cognition can work. We begin life with memory, attention, perception and some cognitive processes already working in specified ways. Cognition develops further through life and our environment has a significant influence; those with common experiences and those sharing a culture will develop some similarities in the way that they think. The converse is also true; different experiences can cause people to perceive and understand the same situations very differently. In multinational and multi-agency operations such differences may not be recognised until something goes wrong. Liaison officers can play an important role in ensuring that mismatches in assumptions, values, language or expectations are discovered and bridged. Cultural differences in cognition are also important when assessing potential enemy courses of action. Commanders must understand that an adversary’s thinking can be very different to their own while being wholly rational to the adversary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Within cultural groups, there will be significant differences in some aspects of thinking. Factors that can account for this include:
• intelligence;
• personality;
• experience;
• learning;
• motivation;
• status and role; and
• physical condition.
Furthermore, the emotional state of individuals, influenced by many of these individual factors, has a fundamental role in thinking.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Group and organisational ideas, understanding, perceptions and attitudes are developed through accumulated thinking by individuals interacting with each other. The products of thinking are captured in external constructs such as concepts, languages and processes that are shared and used collectively.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Working together, collaboratively or in teams, is a central tenet of the approach to solving complex problems. While cognitive factors influence teams, there are a number of factors that can affect how teams develop perceptions, construct meaning, judge, decide and act. These factors include the following.
a. Peer pressure. Peer pressure is the influence exerted on an individual within a peer group to change their opinions, values or behaviours to conform to group norms. This influence can be positive, particularly in terms of team building, and has a fundamental role in building and maintaining team discipline. However, the pressure to conform can inhibit a team’s ability to challenge its collective understanding and its ability to think creatively or to innovate.
b. Groupthink. Groupthink is the tendency to adopt majority decisions, particularly by group members who are similar in background and values and where they perceive a need to present a consensus view (or simply wish to keep their leader happy). Although the focus of such cohesive groups is on the external problem, internal group dynamics may draw out conformity of opinion that is difficult for any individual to overcome, even when they know that the opinion of the group may be wrong. This can lead to the group shortcutting the rational decision-making process so that the majority view is not challenged. In extreme cases, a group may begin to feel invulnerable and may be prone to take excessive risk; it may discount warnings, apply pressure to those who oppose the prevailing mood and create an illusion of unanimity. Overcoming groupthink requires acceptance of authentic dissent; commanders should be aware of this and both encourage and acknowledge dissenting views.
c. Social prejudice. Social prejudice is a belief that another social group is less capable than one’s own. Operating within groups can amplify such beliefs and their unconscious acceptance within a group. The nature of modern operations, set against a diverse cultural and social backdrop, places a priority on the ability to overcome or set aside such prejudices, whether between individual Services, departments or nations.
d. Education and culture. Education and culture can influence the way in which we, as individuals, approach problem solving; the same influence applies to groupthink and analysis. In particular, groups that receive better levels of education unconsciously adopt analytical methodologies and thinking strategies consistent with that education and culture.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The operating environment may produce large amounts of data that constantly changes and not all of which is relevant. Since processing this data would require a much larger brain than we possess, we have evolved mechanisms to deal efficiently with the data most relevant to our needs. Comprehending how the brain works helps us to overcome some of the inherent weaknesses. Annex 2A outlines a range of mechanisms that help us to frame why we think the way we do.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Psychological research generally focuses on two main types of thinking – intuitive and analytical – to compare how effective they are in different situations. Intuitive thinking has been compared with analytical thinking, particularly against reasoning, judgement and decision-making. Complex problems may involve a combination of both thinking modes and it helps to understand which thinking mode is best suited, both at which time and for which part of the problem. Table 2.1 summarises a comparison between analytical and intuitive thinking.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
We have different abilities and preferences that affect when and how well we use different types of thinking. Education, training, experience and changing circumstances influence abilities and preferences. Evidence suggests that people use both types of thinking and can vary the predominance of either according to situation or preference. With self-awareness, gained through education and feedback, people can adapt their thinking strategies.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Logical, analytical approaches to clearly defined problems work well. People (and technologies) can apply systematic reasoning according to rules very effectively. Analytical approaches may not work well in situations that are poorly understood, where there is ambiguity and uncertainty and with no common agreement about the nature of the problem or the desired outcome. Such approaches can give a false sense of progress while the reassuring process of analysis is underway, and can lead to narrow perceptions and result in lost opportunities. The skill is to identify what levels of analytical and intuitive thinking should be used for what sort of situations. It is unlikely to be a question of ‘all analysis’ or ‘all intuition’ for either completely defined problems or completely undefined problems. Most problems demand a blend of analytical and intuitive thought.

Framing is a personality-dependent blend of conscious and subconscious thought. How information is framed can result in individuals drawing different conclusions. Information presented in vivid detail will often lead people to disregard abstract or statistical information that may have greater evidential value. Things that we see or hear directly are likely to have greater impact than second-hand information, even though the latter may have greater value. Similarly, case histories and anecdotes tend to have greater impact than more informative but abstract aggregate or statistical data. We also seldom reflect on an absence of information. The framing effect has implications for how commanders task their staff to present information and the weight they attribute to it.

Those dealing with complex and uncertain situations require a range of thinking skills and the ability to get the best thinking from their organisation. Studies have described leadership in these situations as enabling an organisation to think for itself, to develop ideas and coordinate in a bottom-up manner. In such cases, the means for executing leadership is through social mechanisms that encourage communication and dialogue, develop trust, and stimulate interest and creativity.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Individuals are cognitively resilient if they are able to recognise, adapt to and absorb variants, changes, disturbances and surprises. This is essential for operating effectively in a complex environment but can be degraded by physiological stressors including physical exertion, dehydration, hypothermia, sleep loss and poor diet.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Cognitive (or brain) fitness is described as ‘a state of optimised ability to reason, remember, learn, plan and adapt that is enhanced by certain attitudes, lifestyle choices and exercises’. Cognitive fitness is comparable with physical fitness since cognitive fitness is increased by mental stimulation, physical exercise, good nutrition, stress management and sleep. Equally, it is eroded by chronic stress, fatigue, distraction, anxiety, depression and ageing.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Some tools such as planning templates, mind maps, whiteboards and other visual displays can help to overcome the limitations of short-term memory. For example, doctrine contains templates, derived from best practice, to help execute complex tasks such as the operational estimate and recommends battle rhythms with their associated meetings. However, these templates are only ever guides and they require judgement in application. It is essential to dispel any belief that completing the template means that a satisfactory result has been reached.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Common processes are vital to help disparate organisations work together effectively, particularly when under pressure. We should not, however, become slaves to technology or process at the expense of adapting to, and innovating in, a new operating context. The key is to be flexible enough with any template and to take other partners with you when adaptation is required.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
People will often look to their own experiences or other similar situations to make comparisons and diagnose courses of action that have worked previously. This approach relies upon how accurate the comparison is with the previous situation (and context). Situations may be superficially similar but have radically different underlying properties. When situations are inherently uncertain and ambiguous, there is a higher risk of using inappropriate analogies. Training and education, which includes a wide range of real-world scenarios, can help people to become more effective in using analogy as a tool for understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Expertise is not always the most effective resource. Experts can develop highly efficient ways of thinking, but may inadvertently become less flexible and unable to recognise new perspectives. Sometimes a naive viewpoint will provide a valuable new approach to a situation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The opportunity for, and ability of, individuals to think will depend on external factors, such as individual development, organisational structure and processes, culture, leadership and rewards. The collective ability of individuals within organisations (and organisational ability to capture the product of thinking) will shape an organisation’s capability to generate effective thinking.
<|endoftext|>

When making decisions, commanders will have to rely on information, ideas and suggestions from their team. Good teams provide balanced, critical advice, and provide the staff functions that enable the commander time to think. There are different ways for commanders to structure teams to mitigate the individual, group and organisational limitations for problem solving. Some of these approaches are explored in this section.
a. A multi-discipline approach. Increasing specialisation is a natural response to the opportunities created by modern technology, but places high demands on technical knowledge. This requires a multi-discipline approach to problem solving, including approaches such as joint organisations, albeit with the purpose of integrating specialist knowledge and capabilities without diluting them.
b. Task-orientated teams. Rigid organisational structures may not adjust effectively to new tasks and can stifle effective inter-agency collaboration. Commanders should consider forming task-orientated teams and, if necessary, realign existing structures.
c. Red teams. One way to counter the effects of cognitive bias is to form a group whose aim is to challenge the commander’s plan. Red teams may have a broader role to seek out dissenting and novel ideas and to present alternative and critical perspectives on all aspects of the problem. A red team can monitor groupthink bias and ensure that sufficient analysis and debate has been completed before a policy, plan or strategy is decided.
d. Knowledge networks. Knowledge networks that extend beyond
the organisation can allow commanders to gain access to new ideas and multi-disciplinary expertise. Knowledge networks are also a useful means to test the reliability of existing information and ideas. Deployed commanders have traditionally used reachback to draw on mainly UK-based expertise; however, (within the bounds of operational security) they should also consider wider sources.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
It can be difficult for a red team to gain traction within an existing organisation; such teams, which often approach problems from a novel perspective, can cause anxiety amongst mainstream elements. For red teams to work effectively, commanders must ensure that they have:
• the authority, patronage and support of the commander and chief of staff;
• good lines of communication with the rest of the command; and
• sufficient independence to think critically.
Since red teams are not staff branches, their products need to be injected at some point into the mainstream processes of the organisation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Establishing trust within, and between, groups from different organisations or cultural backgrounds is an essential prerequisite to effective partnering. Such teams require incentives for developing trust, including shared goals and objectives. However, trust takes time to develop. During crises, teams often develop on an ad hoc basis and without a long-term perspective. We characterise such groups as either crisis driven, task-orientated, self-evolving, time-sensitive or temporary.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders need to understand the level of trust that exists within their teams. Table 2.2 lists the attributes of high-trust and low-trust teams, highlighting the advantages of high-trust teams and providing a checklist for commanders to alert them to low-trust team behaviour.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
The term ‘swift trust’ encompasses the vulnerability, uncertainty, risk and expectations that surface within hastily-formed networks. Although behaviour within such personal networks presupposes trust, traditional forms of trust such as familiarity, shared experience and reciprocal disclosure are not obvious. A framework based on the following conditions will serve to build trust more quickly.
a. Reputation. Trust may be based on the reputation of the organisation, rather than the capabilities of an individual. Reputation is context-dependent, so leaders should understand the concerns and aims of prospective partner organisations.
b. Dispositional trust. This refers to the general disposition of an individual to trust other people; some people are more trusting than others.
c. Rules or protocols. The presence of rules or protocols, and the adherence to them, is a safeguard against behaviour which may destabilise an organisation and reduce inter-personal and inter-organisational trust.
d. Organisational factors. Differences in organisational goals, negative organisational stereotypes and ideological differences serve to complicate working relationships between the military and other organisations. Military organisations are typically hierarchies and the members largely conformist; other organisations may prize individualism and be less hierarchical.
e. Specialist roles. People make assumptions about individual ability based on their specialisation, rather than knowledge about their competence or motives. Role-based trust is also described as assumed competence; for example, most people trust doctors to care for their health.
f. Personal contact. Personal contact is vital for building trust within newly formed, multi-disciplinary teams.

Judgement is a key element of decision-making and requires experience and practise. Judgement can be exercised through a collaborative (deliberate) process, through intuition, or a combination of both. Deliberate judgement is a command-led staff process considering all of the facts and determining the options before the commander makes a decision. Intuition is the ability to understand something without the need for conscious reasoning. Intuition may appear subconscious; however, ‘intuitive’ decision-making is based on intellect, experience, education and training which enables decision-makers to recognise patterns, problems and solutions. Intuition is subject to the individual’s own biases, insecurities and idiosyncrasies borne of experience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding can help us to identify risk, as well as actions we can take to mitigate risk. Risk management is an important part of decision-making. Decision-makers may become risk-averse when they have insufficient understanding of a given situation. They may also take greater risk when they believe they have achieved a ‘full’ understanding.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Communicating understanding is an important element of the decision-making process. Creating a clear vision and intent is articulating foresight, the primary outcome of understanding. At the strategic and operational level, the commander’s intent determines campaign design, how we prosecute the campaign or operations, how we allocate resources and the operational priorities.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
At the tactical level, intent provides the rationale for personnel to fight and to know why they are fighting. Vision and intent also form the narrative, which can be general or specific, tailored for an internal or external audience and can be communicated by a number of means. The narrative will evolve over time as understanding and the situation changes.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Systematic exploitation of available networks, and identifying the future potential of emerging networks, is critical to developing understanding and to communicating it. Commanders need to develop their own informal and formal networks to gain information and have their understanding
of a particular situation scrutinised and tested. Knowledge is often thought to be synonymous with power, and not always shared freely in large organisations. The need to challenge views and perceptions underpins understanding and this cannot always be achieved by accepting the institutional status quo. A careful balance must be struck between using formal and informal networks to enable understanding. However, the value inherent in using open-minded informal networks often outweighs the disadvantages.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Understanding requires continuous review. The decision-making process provides a useful vehicle for enabling review through monitoring and evaluation, particularly after action has been taken. This allows further analysis to enhance our understanding. The staff environment at each level should incorporate a formal continuous review process that is properly resourced.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Conducting operations with limited resources demands careful prioritisation and allocation of tasks. Leaders at all levels – political leaders, military commanders and those with the ability and authority to direct a particular group – will usually have resources at their disposal dedicated specifically to developing understanding. Effectively using these resources will require commanders to articulate what needs to be understood. Subordinates should be willing (and able) to add or challenge the commander’s requirements, based on their own understanding of the situation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Commanders should consider their own as well as their staff’s cognitive readiness. This requires assessing the ability to:
• recognise patterns in chaotic situations;
• modify problem solutions in the light of a changing situation; and
• execute plans based upon these solutions.
In the same way that analytical and creative reasoning can be tested, the brain can also be trained.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Some mitigation of cognitive pitfalls is possible through good mental hygiene and habits. Commanders should consider:
• their physical fitness;
• their willingness to change their mind;
• embracing uncertainty and working with it;
• using prompts, frameworks and checklists to explore different perspectives;
• seeking out and challenging assumptions – not doing so is one of the most common pitfalls;
• always seeking alternatives, not stopping at the first good idea;
• using competing hypotheses rather than seeking evidence to support a preferred theory;
• using one-to-one dialogue with a trusted, but culturally different person to stimulate constructive thinking;
• being emotionally self-conscious in decision-making; and
• checking for the effects of bias and heuristics.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Conscious processes are particularly good for analytical thinking, and we recognise and use conscious analysis as the main approach to problem solving. Many of the tools and techniques we deploy support this kind of thinking. We tend to neglect, however, the kind of thinking provided by unconscious processes, which are particularly good for dealing with large amounts of information, complexity, ambiguity and volatility. When we do use unconscious processes, for example, in the form of intuition or creativity, it is often ad hoc and fortuitous. In some situations, especially when there is a need to understand and influence other people, unconscious processes are very effective and commanders should learn to exploit them.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
To ensure an effective balance of thinking skills for any particular situation, commanders can:
• monitor staff over-reliance on analytical thinking;
• employ techniques such as brainstorming that support unconscious thinking and trigger lateral thinking, innovation and new insights;
• assign staff with particular thinking styles or skills to roles and teams; and 
• diagnose their own, their staffs’, partners’ and adversaries’ thinking to exploit or mitigate strengths and weaknesses. Group cultures
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Shared cultures within military groups may reinforce cohesion under stress and contribute towards the moral component of fighting power. However, group culture can be destructive when disparate groups are brought together, even when working towards a common aim. Problems could include:
• antipathy between separate groups developing before they meet; or
•  a clash of different group cultures inhibiting creativity, distorting decision-making or making people reluctant to voice different opinions.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Diverse groups typically consist of members who do not recognise formal structures or authority. Leaders of diverse groups tend to emerge naturally, particularly if they begin as strict conformers but later start to lead in a new direction attractive to other members. In contrast, leaders within the military and other agency groups are appointed and while they can establish their credibility, authority and responsibility within their own hierarchies, they may have to earn this within the wider groups that typically respond to complex problems.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
In large groups, individuals may be able to ‘hide’ or fail to recognise the importance of any one task. Also, key contributions can be lost where the dynamics of a large group inhibit discussion. Group sizes must be managed to ensure that all participants are both seen and able to contribute.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Other factors can make group approaches to decision-making dysfunctional.
a. Initial preferences can become exaggerated during group discussions, a phenomenon known as group polarisation. This can be limited by avoiding uniformity in the composition of the group.
b. Group behaviour may inhibit the ability to share information effectively. Rather than revealing vital information known only to them, individual team members may talk about things that everybody already knows. We can reduce this counter-productive behaviour by disciplined pre-meeting routines that expose what is already known and establish clear boundaries for what the meeting intends to achieve.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Groups have norms or rules that apply to every member, but they often have specific roles and corresponding rules that apply to sub-groups within them. Individuals may be susceptible to group conformity and external pressures when adopting such roles, and may adapt their behaviour to conform to views other than their own. Contributory factors include the fear of disapproval from others, a lack of self-belief or the need to avoid confrontation.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Organisational learning is critical to avoid repeating failure. Organisations identify lessons from their own experiences and from the experiences of others, but organisational learning involves codifying those lessons in modified or new organisational routines. Militaries express their routines in doctrine, training and standard operating procedures that allow them to act in a coordinated and effective way in often highly dynamic and chaotic situations, where failure can have fatal consequences.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Learning is difficult for most organisations, especially if it challenges routines, special interests and cultural norms. These factors will often lead the organisation to reject or ignore important lessons. Organisational learning also requires tolerance of criticism, both internal and external. However, militaries are hierarchical organisations and can be resistant to internal questioning or dissent. Militaries also tend to be sensitive to external criticism, especially from civilians lacking military experience.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Organisational learning should lead to adaptation and, if necessary, innovation. Military adaptation involves incremental changes to tactics, techniques, procedures, structures and equipment to improve performance. However, adaptation is sometimes insufficient and militaries must innovate to retain their advantage over potential adversaries. Innovation often involves large-scale changes, requiring a mix of doctrinal, structural and technological change.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Innovation questions the routines and systems that underpin core competencies, which can deteriorate quickly without rigorous training, exercises and experience on operations. Innovation may be viewed as threatening existing capabilities in which militaries have made heavy investment and around which sub-community interests and cultures have developed. However, organisational innovation is crucial if we are to develop the capacity to anticipate and prepare for the future characteristics of conflict.
<|endoftext|>

<|startoftext|>
Unhindered by bureaucracy and process, the relatively decentralised organisational structure of irregular opponents may enable them to learn and adapt faster than our own highly centralised structures. Similarly, fewer, less well-defined routines should make them more responsive to their environments, with a faster learning capacity. Organisation-wide application of lessons and the ability to codify and disseminate them relies on organisation and a large repertoire of competencies and capabilities. Irregular organisations will vary in their ability to adapt; some will be highly adaptive, others will be surprisingly slow to adapt and make persistent tactical errors. However, militaries are usually slow to innovate and irregular opponents may enjoy the advantage of not being bound by narrow organisational interests defending existing ways of operating. They also often lack cultural and bureaucratic obstacles to innovation. In summary, decentralised organisations tend to be fast learners and are better at innovating than adapting; centralised organisations are better at organisation-wide learning and adapting.
